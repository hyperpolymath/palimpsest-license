= Palimpsest Tooling Suite
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 2

The `/tools` directory contains the provenance and compliance utilities that support the Palimpsest‑MPL License ecosystem.  
These tools help maintain provenance integrity, verify authorship, and ensure that repositories remain reversible, auditable, and aligned with PMPL principles.

== Overview

The suite currently includes:

* `pmpl-sign/` – Create cryptographic signatures and embed provenance metadata.
* `pmpl-verify/` – Verify signatures and validate provenance chains.
* `pmpl-audit/` – Perform repository‑level audits (SPDX, manifests, provenance).
* `integrations/` – Templates and examples for integrating PMPL tools into CI/CD.

Each tool is written in Rust and built using Cargo.

== Building the Tools

To build all tools:

----
just build
----

To run tests:

----
just test
----

To validate compliance (SPDX, manifests, docs):

----
just validate
----

== Directory Structure

----

├── pmpl-sign/       # Signing tool
├── pmpl-verify/     # Verification tool
├── pmpl-audit/      # Repository audit tool
└── integrations/    # Integration templates and examples

== Philosophy

These tools embody the core Palimpsest principles:

* provenance integrity  
* emotional lineage  
* reversibility  
* auditability  
* narrative clarity  

They are optional for adopters but recommended for projects that want strong provenance guarantees.

== Roadmap

See `docs/tooling.adoc` for the full roadmap and future capabilities.
