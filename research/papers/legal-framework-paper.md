## Abstract (250 words)

**Key Points to Cover**:
- The inadequacy of existing copyright frameworks in addressing AI training on creative works
- Introduction of "emotional lineage" as a legal concept rooted in moral rights traditions
- Comparative analysis across Dutch, English, and Scots law
- The Palimpsest License as a novel legal instrument balancing creator protection with technological innovation
- Implications for future AI regulation and intellectual property policy

**Draft Abstract**:

The advent of generative artificial intelligence has exposed critical gaps in intellectual property law's ability to protect creators' interests. Whilst copyright law addresses economic rights and, in civil law jurisdictions, certain moral rights, it fails to capture the broader cultural, emotional, and symbolic dimensions of creative work—particularly when such work is used to train non-interpretive AI systems without consent.

This paper introduces the concept of "emotional lineage" as a juridical framework for protecting the narrative intent, cultural context, and symbolic meaning embedded in creative works. Drawing on comparative analysis of Dutch *Auteurswet*, UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and Scots law, we demonstrate how existing moral rights provisions provide partial but insufficient protection for creators in the AI age.

We present the Palimpsest License v0.4 as a case study in innovative licensing design, examining its legal basis across three jurisdictions and its mechanisms for requiring explicit consent for non-interpretive AI uses whilst permitting transformative human-led adaptations. Through hypothetical case studies, we analyse enforceability challenges and propose policy interventions.

Our findings suggest that emotional lineage can be operationalised through licensing frameworks that extend moral rights principles, though legislative reform is needed to provide comprehensive protection. We conclude with recommendations for EU and UK policymakers addressing the forthcoming AI Act implementation and potential copyright reform.

## 1. Introduction (2000 words)

### 1.1 The AI Training Crisis in Copyright Law

**Subsections**:

  - Statistics on datasets (Common Crawl, LAION-5B, etc.) [CITE: Henderson et al, 2024, "Foundation Models and Fair Use"]
  - Lack of transparency from AI companies regarding training data [CITE: Sag, 2023, "Copyright Safety for Generative AI"]
  - Economic impact on creators' markets

- **1.1.2 Existing Legal Responses and Their Limitations**
  - US fair use defence: transformative use doctrine [CITE: Campbell v Acuff-Rose Music, Inc, 510 US 569 (1994)]
  - EU TDM exceptions: Articles 3 and 4, Directive (EU) 2019/790 [CITE: DSM Directive]
  - UK TDM exception: s 29A CDPA 1988 (now repealed) and ongoing debates [CITE: UK IPO consultation responses, 2022]
  - Critique: Economic focus ignores cultural and emotional dimensions

- **1.1.3 The Consent Gap**
  - No standardised mechanism for expressing consent/refusal for AI training
  - Robots.txt inadequacy: designed for indexing, not training [CITE: Keller, 2023, "Can You Opt Out?"]
  - Platform Terms of Service: Adhesion contracts favouring platforms [CITE: Radin, 2013, "Boilerplate"]

### 1.2 Emotional Lineage: A Conceptual Framework

**Subsections**:
- **1.2.1 Defining Emotional Lineage**
  - Beyond economic and moral rights: protecting narrative intent, cultural context, symbolic meaning
  - Examples: protest songs (We Shall Overcome), diaspora poetry, trauma narratives
  - Connection to restorative justice and cultural appropriation discourse

- **1.2.2 Theoretical Foundations**
  - Continental moral rights (*droits moraux*): integrity, attribution, divulgation [CITE: Stromholm, 1983, "Droit Moral"]

  - Scots law's protection of honour and reputation [CITE: MacQueen & Waelde, 2020, "Contemporary Intellectual Property"]
  - Cultural heritage law: UNESCO conventions, Indigenous IP [CITE: Janke, 2003, "Minding Culture"]

- **1.2.3 Emotional Lineage Distinguished from Existing Rights**
  - Not merely "moral rights plus": separate juridical category
  - Focuses on use context and derivative intent, not just authorship acknowledgement
  - Protects collective and individual creators
  - Addresses AI-specific harms: decontextualisation, pattern extraction without comprehension

### 1.3 Research Questions and Methodology

**Research Questions**:
1. Can emotional lineage be operationalised within existing copyright and moral rights frameworks in Dutch, English, and Scots law?
2. What legal mechanisms can require consent for non-interpretive AI training whilst preserving transformative human creativity?

4. What legislative reforms would strengthen protection for emotional lineage?

**Methodology**:
- Doctrinal analysis: Statutory interpretation and case law across three jurisdictions
- Comparative law: Identifying harmonisation opportunities and conflicts

### 3.4 Comparative Analysis: Harmonisation and Divergence

**Comparative Table**:
| Aspect | Netherlands | England & Wales | Scotland |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| Moral rights inalienability | Yes (Art 25) | No (s 87 CDPA) | No (s 87 CDPA) |
| Integrity threshold | Objective + subjective | Derogatory (high bar) | Derogatory (high bar) |
| TDM exception | DSM Art 4 (pending) | None (s 29A repealed) | None (s 29A repealed) |
| Contract good faith | Yes (BW 6:248) | Limited | Strong tradition |
| Enforcement culture | Pro-author | Balanced | Pro-author (potentially) |

**Key Findings**:
- Dutch law offers strongest moral rights foundation for emotional lineage
- UK law more flexible for contractual innovation but weaker baseline protection
- Scots law offers hybrid potential: CDPA + good faith/personality traditions
- All three jurisdictions permit licensing restrictions on use (subject to competition law)
- Enforcement across jurisdictions requires careful choice of law and forum selection

### 3.5 EU and UK AI Regulation: Emerging Landscape

**Subsections**:

- **3.5.2 UK AI Regulation Proposals**
  - Principles-based approach (transparency, fairness, accountability) [CITE: UK Government, 2023, AI White Paper]
  - No horizontal AI legislation yet
  - Sector-specific regulation (financial services, healthcare)
  - IP and AI: Ongoing consultations [CITE: UK IPO, 2024]

- **3.5.3 Interaction with Licensing Frameworks**
  - AI Act's copyright clause creates legal obligation to respect licensing terms
  - Palimpsest License as compliance mechanism for Art 53(1)(c)
  - Potential for contractual terms to "fill gaps" in statutory law
  - Risk: Without legislative reform, enforcement depends on contract law alone

## 4. Palimpsest License Analysis: Legal Basis and Mechanisms (4000 words)

### 4.1 License Overview and Structural Analysis

**Subsections**:
- **4.1.1 Design Philosophy**
  - Layered protection: economic rights + moral rights + emotional lineage + technical measures
  - Bilingual framework: Dutch (primary legal), English (informative)
  - Version 0.4: transitional phase toward v1.0 (comprehensive reform)

- **4.1.2 Juridical Nature**
  - Hybrid: Copyright licence + moral rights assertion + contractual terms
  - Conditions vs covenants: Use restrictions as conditions precedent to licence grant
  - Automatic termination upon breach (cf GPL, Creative Commons) [CITE: comparative licensing analysis]

- **4.1.3 Scope of Grant**
  - Permits: Human-led transformative adaptations, archival reproductions, accessibility formats
  - Prohibits: Non-interpretive AI training without explicit consent, metadata stripping
  - Requires: Attribution, emotional lineage acknowledgement, context preservation

### 4.2 Clause-by-Clause Legal Analysis

**Key Clauses** (analysed in detail):

#### **Clause 1.2: Non-Interpretive (NI) Systems Consent Requirement**

**Text** (paraphrased for analysis):
> "Use of this work to train, fine-tune, or improve non-interpretive systems (including but not limited to generative AI, recommendation algorithms, surveillance tools) requires explicit written consent from the copyright holder."

**Legal Basis**:
- **Dutch Law**:
  - Economic right of reproduction (Art 1 *Auteurswet*): Training requires temporary copies [CITE: CJEU, *Infopaq*, C-5/08]
  - Adaptation right (Art 13): Statistical patterns arguably derivative
  - Conditional licensing valid under contract freedom (BW 6:2)
- **UK Law**:
  - Copying right (s 17 CDPA): Training involves copying into memory/storage [CITE: *SAS Institute v World Programming*, C-406/10, on limits]
  - Implied licence doctrine doesn't extend to AI training [CITE: *Railway Media v Coy*, distinguishing permissible uses]
  - Conditional licensing enforceable [CITE: contract law principles]
- **Scots Law**: Same as UK (CDPA applies) + good faith obligation strengthens enforceability

**Enforceability Analysis**:
- **Strengths**: Clear language, grounded in reproduction right, supported by EU AI Act Art 53(1)(c)
- **Challenges**:
  - Proving that training occurred (evidentiary burden)
  - "Non-interpretive" definition: Needs technical precision (addressed in License metadata)
  - Jurisdiction: AI companies often extraterritorial
- **Hypothetical Case**: If Stability AI trained on Palimpsest-licensed work without consent, author could claim:
  1. Copyright infringement (unauthorised reproduction)
  2. Breach of licence conditions (if accessed via licensed platform)
  3. Moral rights violation (if outputs distort work)

#### **Clause 2.3: Metadata Preservation**

**Text** (paraphrased):
> "All copies, adaptations, and distributions must preserve embedded metadata including author attribution, licence terms, emotional context tags, and quantum-proof hashes."

**Legal Basis**:
- **Dutch Law**:
  - Attribution right (Art 25 sub 1): Metadata facilitates attribution
  - Technological protection measures (*technische voorzieningen*): Art 29a *Auteurswet* (implementing InfoSoc Directive Art 6)
- **UK Law**:
  - Attribution right (s 77 CDPA): Metadata as form of attribution
  - Electronic Rights Management Information (s 296ZG CDPA): Protection for metadata
- **EU Law**:
  - InfoSoc Directive Art 6-7: TPMs and rights management information [CITE: Directive 2001/29/EC]

**Enforceability Analysis**:
- **Strengths**: Aligns with existing legal protections (s 296ZG, Art 29a), technically verifiable (hashes)
- **Challenges**: Enforcement depends on detection (requires monitoring), remedies may be limited to statutory damages
- **Hypothetical Case**: Scraper removes metadata before ingesting into training dataset
  - Claim: Breach of s 296ZG (UK), Art 29a (NL)
  - Remedy: Statutory damages + injunction against further use

#### **Clause 3.1: Emotional Lineage Acknowledgement**

**Text** (paraphrased):
> "Derivative works must acknowledge the emotional lineage, cultural context, and symbolic intent of the original work, particularly where the work addresses trauma, diaspora experiences, or cultural resistance."

**Legal Basis**:
- **Dutch Law**:
  - Integrity right (Art 25 sub 1d): Contextual stripping as "mutilation"
  - Personality rights: Emotional connection to work protected [CITE: case law on personality]
- **UK Law**:
  - Integrity right (s 80): Removal of context as "derogatory treatment"?
    - Threshold issue: Is it "prejudicial to honour or reputation"? [CITE: *Pasterfield v Denham*]
    - Arguable in narrow cases (e.g., trauma narrative used in commercial comedy AI)
  - Contract law: Licence condition enforceable as contractual obligation

**Enforceability Analysis**:
- **Strengths**: Novel but grounded in moral rights; contractual enforceability clearer than statutory
- **Challenges**: "Emotional lineage" lacks statutory definition; courts may view as non-justiciable sentiment
- **Hypothetical Case**: AI generates synthetic "refugee poetry" trained on diaspora poet's Palimpsest-licensed work
  - Dutch court: Likely finds integrity violation (contextual mutilation)
  - UK court: Uncertain; depends on "derogatory" interpretation + contractual claim stronger
  - Remedy: Injunction against distribution, damages for moral harm

#### **Clause 4.2: Quantum-Proof Traceability**

**Text** (paraphrased):
> "Works must include post-quantum cryptographic signatures enabling provenance verification in the event of quantum computing advances."

**Legal Basis**:
- **Technical measure, not directly legal**: But supported by:
  - TPM protections (Art 6 InfoSoc Directive, s 296 CDPA, Art 29a *Auteurswet*)
  - Evidentiary value: Cryptographic proof aids copyright infringement claims [CITE: digital forensics in IP litigation]
  - Future-proofing: Anticipates quantum computing threat to SHA-256, RSA

**Enforceability Analysis**:
- **Strengths**: Technical robustness, aligns with InfoSoc TPM regime
- **Challenges**: Requires adoption of post-quantum algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Dilithium) [CITE: NIST PQC standards]; current implementations rare
- **Hypothetical Case**: In 2035, quantum computer breaks SHA-256 hash, attacker claims work is unprovenanced
  - Palimpsest License holder with CRYSTALS-Dilithium signature can prove authorship
  - Legal relevance: Evidentiary, not substantive right, but critical for enforcement

### 4.3 Governance and Amendment Mechanisms

**Subsections**:
- **4.3.1 Palimpsest Stewardship Council**
  - Structure: 7 members (3 creators, 2 legal, 1 tech, 1 cultural heritage) [CITE: GOVERNANCE.md]
  - Decision-making: Major changes require 6/7 vote + 90-day community consultation
  - Legal status: Unclear if binding on licensees or purely administrative
  - Comparison to Creative Commons, FSF governance [CITE: CC legal structure, GPL stewardship]

- **4.3.2 Versioning and Backward Compatibility**
  - Works licensed under v0.3 remain under v0.3 unless relicensed
  - v0.4 introduces stricter NI consent, metadata requirements
  - Legal question: Can licence auto-upgrade? Generally no (copyright holder must relicense) [CITE: licensing principles]

- **4.3.3 DAO Integration (Proposed)**
  - Collective licensing via decentralised autonomous organisation
  - Smart contracts for automated royalty distribution [CITE: blockchain and IP scholarship]
  - Legal challenges: DAO legal personality, enforceability across jurisdictions [CITE: Reyes, 2019, "If Rockefeller Were a Coder"]

### 4.4 Compatibility with Existing Licensing Regimes

**Subsections**:
- **4.4.1 Creative Commons Comparison**
  - CC: Permissive, focused on sharing (BY, SA, NC, ND modules) [CITE: CC licences]
  - Palimpsest: Protective, focused on consent and emotional lineage
  - Potential hybrid: CC-BY-SA + Palimpsest NI clause? [CITE: compatibility analysis]

- **4.4.2 Copyleft Licences (GPL, etc.)**
  - GPL: Software freedom, share-alike [CITE: GPL v3]
  - Palimpsest: Creative work freedom, emotional integrity
  - Shared principle: Conditions on downstream use
  - Difference: GPL doesn't address AI training (pre-dates issue)

- **4.4.3 Proprietary and Restrictive Licences**
  - All Rights Reserved + bespoke terms: Similar flexibility
  - Palimpsest advantage: Standardised, community-vetted, ethical framing
  - Disadvantage: Less familiar to industry, potential friction in commercial contexts

## 5. Case Studies: Hypothetical Scenarios and Enforceability (3000 words)

### 5.1 Scenario 1: Diaspora Poet vs Generative AI Company

**Facts**:
- Amara, Nigerian-British poet, publishes collection "Fragments of Belonging" (2024) under Palimpsest License v0.4
- Work addresses displacement, identity, intergenerational trauma
- Hosted on personal website (London-based server) and platforms (Medium, Archive.org)
- 2025: AI company "SynthVerse" (Delaware corporation, operates globally) scrapes work for training "PoetryBot" generative AI
- PoetryBot generates synthetic "diaspora poetry" on demand, marketed commercially
- SynthVerse did not seek consent, stripped metadata

**Legal Analysis**:

- **Jurisdiction**:
  - Amara (UK/Nigeria dual national, resident in UK)
  - SynthVerse (US company, servers in US/EU/Asia)
  - Acts: Scraping (possibly UK/US), training (likely US), distribution (global)
  - Applicable law: Likely English law (server location, Amara's domicile), possibly US (SynthVerse location)
  - Forum: English High Court (Brussels Ibis Regulation for EU assets), US courts if suing in US

- **Claims** (if in English courts):
  1. **Copyright infringement** (s 17 CDPA): Scraping = copying
     - Defence: Unlikely fair dealing (commercial purpose, substantial taking)
     - Strength: Strong
  2. **Breach of licence conditions**: Used for NI system without consent
     - Licence = contract if SynthVerse accessed via terms [CITE: *Beta Computers v Adobe* [1996]]
     - Strength: Medium (depends on proving contractual relationship)
  3. **Moral rights** (s 80 CDPA): Derogatory treatment?
     - Threshold: Does synthetic diaspora poetry harm Amara's honour/reputation?
     - Arguable: Yes, if PoetryBot trivialises trauma, commodifies pain
     - Strength: Medium-weak (high threshold)
  4. **Metadata stripping** (s 296ZG CDPA): ERMI removal
     - Strict liability, statutory damages
     - Strength: Strong (if metadata qualified as ERMI)

- **Remedies**:
  - Injunction: Prohibit further PoetryBot distribution, remove infringing model
  - Damages: Economic (lost licensing fees, PoetryBot revenue apportionment) + non-economic (moral harm)
  - Account of profits: SynthVerse's PoetryBot revenues [CITE: s 96(2) CDPA]
  - Publicity: Judgment could set precedent, deter other AI companies

- **Outcome Prediction**:
  - **Strong case** on copyright infringement and metadata stripping
  - **Moderate case** on moral rights (depends on evidence of reputational harm)
  - **Settlement likely**: AI companies risk adverse precedent, may settle with licensing agreement

### 5.2 Scenario 2: Protest Song and Commercial Algorithm

**Facts**:
- "Rise Again", folk protest song (2023) about climate justice, licensed under Palimpsest (Dutch law, Amsterdam-based artist)
- Music streaming platform "Harmonia" (Irish company, EU-wide operations) uses song in recommendation algorithm training without consent
- Algorithm recommends "Rise Again" alongside commercial pop, decontextualises political message
- Artist alleges integrity violation, seeks enforcement in Dutch courts

**Legal Analysis**:

- **Jurisdiction**:
  - Artist (Netherlands)
  - Harmonia (Ireland, operates in Netherlands)
  - Brussels Ibis Regulation: Dutch courts have jurisdiction (Art 7(2), tort occurred in NL)
  - Applicable law: Dutch law (licence specifies)

- **Claims** (Dutch courts):
  1. **Copyright infringement** (Art 1 *Auteurswet*): Algorithm training = reproduction
     - EU TDM exception (Art 4 DSM Directive, if implemented): Artist opted out via Palimpsest metadata
     - Strength: Strong (opt-out respected under Art 4)
  2. **Integrity right** (Art 25 sub 1d): Algorithmic decontextualisation = mutilation?
     - Dutch courts: Broad interpretation of "mutilation" [CITE: *Le Corbusier*]
     - Arguable: Recommendation alongside apolitical music distorts political intent
     - Strength: Medium (novel application, but Dutch courts sympathetic to moral rights)
  3. **Breach of licence**: NI system use without consent
     - Licence accepted when Harmonia accessed work (platform ToS + Palimpsest terms)
     - Strength: Strong (contractual claim clear)

- **Remedies**:
  - Injunction: Cease using "Rise Again" in algorithm
  - Damages: Economic (licensing fee) + moral harm (personality rights violation)
  - Declaratory judgment: Affirming Palimpsest License validity in Dutch law

- **Outcome Prediction**:
  - **Very strong case** under Dutch law (robust moral rights, TDM opt-out respected)
  - **Likely victory**: Injunction granted, damages awarded
  - **Precedent value**: Establishes algorithmic decontextualisation as moral rights violation

### 5.3 Scenario 3: Academic Use and Fair Dealing

**Facts**:
- Researcher analyses Palimpsest-licensed poetry corpus (100 poems) for PhD thesis on "AI and Emotional Lineage"
- Uses computational text analysis (sentiment analysis, topic modelling), excerpts in thesis
- Does not train generative AI, cites all works, preserves metadata
- Palimpsest author alleges breach (computational analysis = NI system)

**Legal Analysis**:

- **Jurisdiction**: Assume UK (researcher at Scottish university)

- **Is this a breach?**
  - **NI system definition**: Palimpsest defines NI as systems lacking "hermeneutic engagement" (see metadata/technical specifications)
  - **Sentiment analysis**: Arguable—extracts patterns without interpreting meaning
  - **Researcher's intent**: Scholarly analysis, not commercial deployment
  - **Licence interpretation**: Likely **not a breach**—academic research with attribution falls under permitted "human-led transformative adaptation"

- **If disputed**:
  - **Fair dealing defence** (s 29 CDPA): Research and private study
    - Non-commercial purpose: Yes
    - Sufficient acknowledgement: Yes
    - Amount taken: Reasonable for analysis
    - Strength: Strong
  - **Moral rights**: Researcher cited, preserved context, acknowledged emotional lineage
    - No breach of attribution or integrity

- **Outcome Prediction**:
  - **No infringement**: Palimpsest License permits research, fair dealing applies
  - **Illustrates**: Need for clear definitional boundaries (NI vs interpretive systems)

### 5.4 Scenario 4: Cross-Border Enforcement Challenges

**Facts**:
- Palimpsest-licensed work (Scots law) scraped by Chinese AI company with no EU/UK presence
- Author seeks enforcement, discovers:
  - No assets in UK/EU jurisdictions
  - China's copyright law lacks moral rights equivalent
  - Training data hosted on servers in jurisdiction with weak IP enforcement

**Legal Analysis**:

- **Jurisdictional Obstacles**:
  - No personal jurisdiction over Chinese company in UK courts (absent assets or operations)
  - Brussels Ibis doesn't apply (non-EU defendant)
  - Hague Convention on Jurisdiction (if ratified): Possible basis, but uncertain

- **Applicable Law**:
  - Lex loci protectionis: Copyright infringement judged by law of protection country
  - If infringement in UK (scraping from UK server), UK law applies
  - If infringement in China (training there), Chinese law applies (weak protection)

- **Enforcement**:
  - UK judgment likely unenforceable in China (no reciprocal enforcement treaty for IP)
  - Practical remedies:
    - Publicise violation (reputational harm)
    - Advocate for Chinese legal reform (unlikely short-term)
    - Technical measures: Geofencing, access controls

- **Outcome Prediction**:
  - **Practical unenforceability** across jurisdictions without mutual recognition
  - **Highlights**: Need for international harmonisation (WIPO, Berne Convention reform)

### 5.5 Synthesis: Enforceability Factors

**Key Findings**:
- **Strong enforceability** in jurisdictions with robust moral rights (Netherlands, France, Germany)
- **Moderate enforceability** in UK (contract law + limited moral rights)
- **Weak enforceability** in US (absent legislative reform) and non-Berne jurisdictions
- **Critical factors**:
  1. Jurisdiction and choice of law clauses in licence
  2. Evidence of harm (economic + moral)
  3. Defendant's assets/presence in forum jurisdiction
  4. Clarity of licence terms (ambiguity undermines enforcement)
  5. Judicial familiarity with AI technologies

## 6. Discussion: Limitations, Critiques, and Policy Recommendations (2000 words)

### 6.1 Limitations of Licensing Approaches

**Subsections**:
- **6.1.1 Contractual Privity**
  - Licences bind only parties in contractual relationship
  - Third-party scrapers may avoid liability (no contract formed)
  - Possible solution: Statutory backing for licensing terms (e.g., TDM opt-out in DSM Directive)

- **6.1.2 Enforcement Burden**
  - Individual creators lack resources to litigate against well-funded AI companies
  - Collective action needed: Unions, guilds, licensing collectives
  - Comparison to music industry: ASCAP, PRS for Music models [CITE: collective licensing history]

- **6.1.3 Detection and Monitoring**
  - Proving work was in training data: Forensic challenges [CITE: Carlini et al, 2023, "Extracting Training Data from LLMs"]
  - AI companies' opacity: Refuse to disclose datasets
  - Technical solution: Watermarking, hash-based detection [CITE: proposed methods]

- **6.1.4 International Jurisdiction**
  - AI companies often operate extraterritorially
  - Enforcement depends on mutual recognition of judgments
  - Gaps: US-EU, EU-China enforcement

### 6.2 Critiques and Counter-Arguments

**Subsections**:
- **6.2.1 "Emotional Lineage" as Legal Concept**
  - **Critique**: Too subjective, non-justiciable, courts won't enforce sentiment
  - **Counter-argument**:
    - Moral rights already protect subjective elements (honour, reputation)
    - Expert testimony can establish cultural/emotional context
    - Contractual framing makes it enforceable as agreed term

- **6.2.2 Innovation and Access Concerns**
  - **Critique**: Restricting AI training stifles innovation, limits beneficial AI applications
  - **Counter-argument**:
    - Consent ≠ prohibition; creators can licence for fair terms
    - Innovation doesn't justify exploitation (cf. music sampling, which requires licensing)
    - Public domain and CC-licensed works remain available

- **6.2.3 Definitional Challenges**
  - **Critique**: "Non-interpretive" unclear, creates legal uncertainty
  - **Counter-argument**:
    - Technical specification in licence metadata provides guidance
    - Courts regularly interpret technical terms (e.g., "computer program" in *SAS v WPL*)
    - Can evolve via Council amendments, case law

- **6.2.4 Compatibility with Remix Culture**
  - **Critique**: Palimpsest too restrictive, hinders transformative creativity
  - **Counter-argument**:
    - Permits human-led adaptations, sampling with attribution
    - Targets automated extraction, not artistic remixing
    - Balance: Protects vulnerable creators, allows respectful transformation

### 6.3 Policy Recommendations

**Subsections**:
- **6.3.1 For EU Legislators (AI Act Implementation)**
  - **Recommendation 1**: Amend AI Act Art 53(1)(c) to require affirmative consent for copyrighted training data, not just "compliance"
  - **Recommendation 2**: Create private right of action for copyright holders against non-compliant AI providers
  - **Recommendation 3**: Mandate transparency: AI companies must disclose training datasets (with privacy safeguards)
  - **Recommendation 4**: Support collective licensing schemes for AI training (extended collective licensing model) [CITE: Nordic ECL systems]

- **6.3.2 For UK Government (Copyright Reform)**
  - **Recommendation 1**: Strengthen moral rights (inalienability, broaden integrity right)
  - **Recommendation 2**: Introduce opt-in TDM exception (reverse current opt-out proposal)
  - **Recommendation 3**: Create statutory damages for metadata stripping (harmonise with s 296ZG)
  - **Recommendation 4**: Establish AI training licensing framework (clearance mechanism, government-backed collective)

- **6.3.3 For Dutch Policymakers**
  - **Recommendation 1**: Lead EU on robust TDM opt-out implementation (model for other Member States)
  - **Recommendation 2**: Expand *Auteurswet* to explicitly cover AI training as "reproduction"
  - **Recommendation 3**: Fund test cases establishing moral rights in AI context
  - **Recommendation 4**: Support international harmonisation (Berne Convention reform, WIPO AI treaty)

- **6.3.4 For International Bodies (WIPO, UNESCO)**
  - **Recommendation 1**: Develop international treaty on AI training and copyright (Berne Convention protocol)
  - **Recommendation 2**: Integrate cultural heritage protections (UNESCO ICH Convention + copyright)
  - **Recommendation 3**: Create model law for emotional lineage protections (sui generis right)
  - **Recommendation 4**: Support Global South creators: Capacity-building, enforcement assistance

- **6.3.5 For Judicial Systems**
  - **Recommendation 1**: Training for judges on AI technologies and impacts
  - **Recommendation 2**: Specialist IP tribunals with AI expertise
  - **Recommendation 3**: Expedited procedures for AI infringement cases (time-sensitive)
  - **Recommendation 4**: Cross-border cooperation: Mutual recognition of judgments (Hague Convention expansion)

### 6.4 Future Directions for Legal Scholarship

**Research Gaps**:
- Empirical studies: How do creators perceive emotional lineage? What licensing terms do they prefer?
- Comparative: How do non-Western jurisdictions address AI and cultural heritage?
- Technical-legal: Optimal design for machine-readable consent mechanisms
- Philosophical: Justifications for emotional lineage rights (beyond Lockean labour theory)

## 7. Conclusion (1000 words)

### 7.1 Summary of Findings

**Key Points**:
1. **Emotional lineage** is a viable juridical concept, grounded in moral rights traditions but extending beyond them to protect narrative intent, cultural context, and symbolic meaning
2. **Comparative analysis** reveals Dutch law offers strongest foundation (inalienable moral rights, personality protections), UK law offers contractual flexibility, Scots law presents hybrid potential
3. **Palimpsest License v0.4** represents innovative licensing design, legally enforceable (particularly Clause 1.2 NI consent, Clause 2.3 metadata preservation) but faces practical challenges (detection, cross-border enforcement)
4. **Case studies** demonstrate enforceability varies by jurisdiction: strong in Netherlands, moderate in UK, weak extraterritorially
5. **Policy reform needed**: Licensing alone insufficient; requires statutory backing (AI Act amendments, UK copyright reform, international treaties)

### 7.2 Contributions to Legal Scholarship

**Novel Contributions**:
- First comprehensive tri-jurisdictional analysis of licensing frameworks for AI training consent
- Theorisation of emotional lineage as operative legal category
- Practical enforcement roadmap for creators and policymakers
- Integration of cultural heritage law with copyright and AI regulation

### 7.3 Implications for Practice

**For Creators**:
- Palimpsest License offers robust protection, particularly in civil law jurisdictions
- Collective action (guilds, unions) essential for enforcement
- Combine licensing with technical measures (metadata, watermarking, access controls)

**For AI Companies**:
- Ignoring licensing terms creates legal risk, particularly under EU AI Act
- Consent-based training models are feasible (licensed datasets, opt-in schemes)
- Reputational and regulatory pressures will increase

**For Platforms**:
- Responsibility to facilitate consent mechanisms (ToS integration, metadata preservation)
- Liability risks for enabling infringement (hosting scraped datasets)
- Opportunity: Position as ethical AI leaders by supporting creator rights

### 7.4 The Path Forward: Legislation, Litigation, and Culture

**Legislation**:
- EU AI Act implementation: 2024-2027 critical window for robust rules
- UK copyright reform: Opportunity to lead globally on creator-centric AI policy
- International harmonisation: Berne Convention, WIPO treaty negotiations

**Litigation**:
- Test cases in Netherlands, UK, US will shape AI copyright landscape
- Creator coalitions (Authors Guild, NUJ, SAA) filing strategic cases
- Expect AI company defences: fair use, TDM exceptions, innovation necessity

**Culture**:
- Shift in norms: From "data is free" to "consent is required"
- Parallel to GDPR's impact on privacy culture
- Emotional lineage resonates with public values (trauma sensitivity, cultural respect)

### 7.5 Concluding Reflection

The Palimpsest License, and the concept of emotional lineage it embodies, represents more than a legal instrument. It is a moral claim: that creative work carries meaning beyond its economic value, that narrative intent and cultural context deserve protection, and that creators—particularly those from marginalised communities—merit autonomy over how their work is used in the age of AI.

Whilst licensing innovation can bridge gaps in statutory law, it cannot replace the need for comprehensive legislative reform. Policymakers in the EU, UK, and globally must act swiftly to enshrine consent mechanisms, transparency obligations, and moral rights protections in AI regulation. The alternative—a digital landscape where creators' works are extracted without permission, their stories commodified without context, their trauma data-mined without consent—is ethically and legally untenable.

This paper has demonstrated that emotional lineage is not merely aspirational but legally grounded, practically enforceable, and urgently necessary. The question is no longer whether law can protect creators in the AI age, but whether we have the political will to make it so.
