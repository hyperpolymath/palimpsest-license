  - Music files absorbed
  - Code repositories pulled
- Counter appears showing billions of works ingested
- Bot fills with content, glowing purple/orange (warning colour)

**Voiceover:**

- Text: "Human Use: Free | AI Training: Consent Required"

**Voiceover:**
> "It's a new licensing framework that says: Your work can still be shared freely for human use. But AI training requires your explicit consent. It's not anti-AI. It's pro-consent."

**Audio:**
- Music: Balanced, harmonious (showing equilibrium)

## Complete Voiceover Script (Word-for-Word, Timed)

**[0:05-0:15] (27 words)**
You create. You share. You contribute to the internet.

**[0:15-0:30] (41 words)**
But here's what's happening behind the scenes: AI systems—ChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion—are training on your work. They scrape billions of images, articles, songs, and code from the internet. Your creations are in there.

**[0:30-0:45] (31 words)**
And here's the thing: They didn't ask. They didn't pay. They didn't credit you. They call it 'publicly available data.' But you never consented to AI training.

**[1:00-1:15] (27 words)**
You might be thinking: What about Creative Commons? Or copyright law? Here's the problem: Those licences were written before AI training existed at this scale.

**[1:15-1:30] (30 words)**
They address human use—sharing, remixing, attribution. They don't distinguish between 'reading your article' and 'training an AI on it to generate similar content.'

**[1:30-1:45] (14 words)**
AI companies are exploiting that gap. And creators have no recourse.

**[1:45-2:00] (5 words)**
Enter the Palimpsest Licence.

**[2:00-2:15] (37 words)**
It's a new licensing framework that says: Your work can still be shared freely for human use. But AI training requires your explicit consent. It's not anti-AI. It's pro-consent.

**[2:15-2:30] (13 words)**

Here's how Palimpsest works: Step 1: You licence your work under Palimpsest. Add one file to your website or repository.

**[2:42-2:54] (20 words)**
Step 2: Metadata embeds: 'Consent required for AI training.' This is machine-readable—AI scrapers can detect it automatically.

Step 3: When an AI company wants to train on your work, they check the metadata. It says: 'Permission needed.'

Step 4: They request consent via a Consent Registry. They explain what they want to do—train GPT-6, for example—and offer terms. Maybe £100. Maybe attribution in their model card.

**[3:18-3:30] (32 words)**
Step 5: You decide. Grant consent (accept their offer or negotiate), deny (protect your artistic integrity), or ignore (your work isn't used). You're in control.

**[3:30-3:40] (28 words)**
Early adopters are already seeing results. Maya, a digital artist: 'I sent a cease-and-desist to Stability AI. They removed my work from future training and paid £500.'

**[3:40-3:50] (21 words)**
James, a science fiction author: 'OpenAI requested consent. I negotiated £1,000 plus attribution. Easiest money I ever made.'

**[3:50-4:00] (24 words)**
Keiko, a photographer: 'Midjourney wanted 200 of my photos. I charged £10 each. That's £2,000.' This is happening. Right now.

**[4:00-4:20] (40 words)**
You might be wondering: Isn't this like DRM? No. DRM locks files down—you can't open them without special software. User-hostile. Palimpsest doesn't restrict your device. It's a legal framework. Your files stay open.

Ten thousand creators have adopted Palimpsest. Platforms like GitHub and DeviantArt are exploring integration. AI companies—the ethical ones—are building consent infrastructure.

**[4:45-5:00] (53 words)**
This is the future: An internet where creators are protected, not exploited. Where AI is built ethically, with permission. Ready to join? Visit palimpsest.license. Licence your work. Take back control. Your work. Your consent. Your rights.
