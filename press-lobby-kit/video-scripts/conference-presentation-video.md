## Presentation Structure & Timing

### PART 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00-6:00 / 360 seconds)

#### Slide 1: Title & Introduction (0:00-0:45)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "The Consent Layer for Creative Work"
- Subtitle: "How Palimpsest Licence Protects Creators in the AI Era"
- Presenter name, affiliation
- Conference name, date
- Palimpsest logo

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Good morning/afternoon. I'm [Name], [title] with the Palimpsest Stewardship Council."
>
> "Today I'll introduce you to the Palimpsest Licence—a new licensing framework designed to protect creators in the age of AI training."
>
> "In the next 20 minutes, I'll cover three things:"
>
> "First, the problem: How AI training exploits creators."
>
> "Second, the solution: How Palimpsest introduces a consent layer."
>
> "Third, the path forward: Technical implementation, policy alignment, and collective action."
>
> "Let's begin with the crisis we're facing."

**Timing:** 45 seconds

---

#### Slide 2: AI Training at Scale (0:45-2:00)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "AI Training: The New Enclosure"
- Statistics:
  - GPT-4: 100+ terabytes of text
  - Stable Diffusion: 5 billion images
  - GitHub Copilot: Millions of code repositories
- Visual: AI scraper hoovering content from the internet
- Quote: "Publicly available ≠ permission"

**Speaker Notes:**
> "AI training operates at unprecedented scale."
>
> "GPT-4 was trained on over 100 terabytes of text—billions of articles, books, blog posts, and forum discussions. Your writing is likely in there."
>
> "Stable Diffusion used 5 billion images scraped from the internet. Artists discovered their work in training datasets without permission, without payment."
>
> "GitHub Copilot trained on millions of public repositories—including GPL-licensed code, which legally requires derivatives to be open-sourced. But Copilot's generated code doesn't carry GPL licensing."
>
> "The justification? 'It's publicly available data.'"
>
> "But publicly available does not mean permission granted. If I can see a painting in a gallery, that doesn't give me the right to commercially reproduce it."
>
> "This is the new enclosure: AI companies privatising the digital commons."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (0:45-2:00)

---

#### Slide 3: Creator Harms (2:00-3:30)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "Three Harms to Creators"
- Visual: Three icons/columns
  1. **Economic Harm**
     - AI companies: £billions in value
     - Creators: £0 in compensation
  2. **Attribution Erasure**
     - AI outputs don't credit sources
     - Voices blended, styles replicated
  3. **Loss of Control**
     - No consent, no opt-out
     - Work used for purposes never intended

**Speaker Notes:**
> "This creates three distinct harms."
>
> "First: Economic harm. AI companies build products worth billions—OpenAI valued at $90 billion, Stability AI at hundreds of millions. Creators who provided the training data? Zero compensation."
>
> "Second: Attribution erasure. AI-generated outputs don't meaningfully credit sources. Your voice gets blended with 10,000 others. Your style replicated without acknowledgement. Artists see AI mimicking their aesthetic—but no attribution, no lineage."
>
> "Third: Loss of control. Creators never consented. Many never knew. Work intended for human readers is now training commercial AI. Trauma narratives, cultural stories, personal expressions—repurposed without permission."
>
> "These aren't abstract harms. They're real, they're widespread, and they're accelerating."

**Timing:** 90 seconds (2:00-3:30)

---

#### Slide 4: Legal Ambiguity (3:30-4:45)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "The Legal Grey Zone"
- Table: Ongoing lawsuits
  | Case | Plaintiff | Defendant | Status |
  |------|-----------|-----------|--------|
  | Getty Images v Stability AI | Getty | Stability | Pending |
  | Authors Guild v OpenAI | Authors | OpenAI | Pending |
  | GitHub Copilot Class Action | Developers | GitHub/Microsoft | Pending |
- Quote: "Fair use for AI training? Courts haven't decided."

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Is this legal? Nobody knows."
>
> "Three major lawsuits are pending as of 2025:"
>
> "Getty Images versus Stability AI: Did training Stable Diffusion on Getty's images violate copyright?"
>
> "Authors Guild versus OpenAI: Did GPT training on copyrighted books constitute fair use?"
>
> "GitHub Copilot class action: Did training on GPL code violate open-source licences?"
>
> "None have reached final judgment. Courts are grappling with novel questions: Is AI training transformative use? Does scale matter? Is commercial intent relevant?"
>
> "The answer could take years—maybe decades—to settle."
>
> "Meanwhile, creators are unprotected."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (3:30-4:45)

---

#### Slide 5: Why Existing Licences Fail (4:45-6:00)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "Why Creative Commons and GPL Don't Help"
- Comparison table:
  | Licence | Addresses Human Use | Addresses AI Training |
  |---------|---------------------|----------------------|
  | CC BY | ✓ | ✗ |
  | CC BY-SA | ✓ | ✗ |
  | GPL | ✓ (code sharing) | ✗ |
  | MIT | ✓ | ✗ |
- Gap visualisation: Licences designed pre-AI era

**Speaker Notes:**
> "You might ask: What about existing licences?"
>
> "Creative Commons, GPL, MIT—they're excellent for human use. Sharing, remixing, attribution."
>
> "But they don't distinguish between 'reading your article' and 'training an AI to generate similar articles.'"
>
> "CC BY says 'share with attribution.' But AI outputs don't meaningfully attribute training sources."
>
> "GPL says 'derivatives must be open-sourced.' But is an AI model trained on GPL code a derivative? Courts haven't decided."
>
> "These licences were written before large-scale AI training existed. They have a conceptual gap."
>
> "AI companies exploit that gap. And creators have no recourse."
>
> "That's the problem. Now let's talk solutions."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (4:45-6:00)

---

### PART 2: THE SOLUTION - PALIMPSEST LICENCE (6:00-14:00 / 480 seconds)

#### Slide 6: Introducing Palimpsest (6:00-7:15)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "The Palimpsest Licence: A Consent Layer"
- Logo: Palimpsest branding
- Tagline: "Your work. Your consent. Your rights."
- Core principle: "AI training requires explicit consent"
- Analogy: "HTTPS for permission"

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Enter the Palimpsest Licence."
>
> "Palimpsest is a consent-layer licensing framework. Here's the core principle:"
>
> "Your work can still be shared freely for human use—reading, sharing, remixing. But AI training requires your explicit consent."
>
> "It's not anti-AI. It's pro-consent."
>
> "Think of it as HTTPS for permission. HTTPS encrypts data in transit. Palimpsest secures consent before use."
>
> "The name 'Palimpsest' refers to manuscripts where old text is scraped off and new text written over. Historically, this destroyed knowledge. Palimpsest the licence prevents that erasure—it preserves lineage, attribution, and creator control."
>
> "Let me walk you through how it works."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (6:00-7:15)

---

#### Slide 7: How Palimpsest Works (7:15-9:00)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "How Palimpsest Works: 5 Steps"
- Visual: Flowchart with 5 nodes
  1. **Creator:** Adds Palimpsest Licence to work
  2. **Metadata:** Machine-readable "consent required" tag
  3. **AI Company:** Scraper detects metadata
  4. **Request:** AI company requests consent via registry
  5. **Decision:** Creator grants, denies, or negotiates

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Here's the workflow."
>
> "Step 1: You, the creator, add the Palimpsest Licence to your work. This is one file—LICENSE.md—in your repository or website."
>
> "Step 2: Metadata embeds. The licence includes machine-readable tags: 'Consent required for AI training.' AI scrapers can detect this automatically."
>
> "Step 3: When an AI company wants to use your work, their scraper checks the metadata. It sees: 'Permission needed.'"
>
> "Step 4: The AI company requests consent via a Consent Registry. They explain what they want to do—train GPT-6, for example—and offer terms. Maybe £100. Maybe attribution in their model card. Maybe just asking politely."
>
> "Step 5: You decide. Grant consent—your work is used, and you get compensation or credit. Deny consent—your work is not used. Or negotiate—counter-offer, request different terms."
>
> "You're in control. Not the AI company. Not the platform. You."

**Timing:** 105 seconds (7:15-9:00)

#### Slide 8: Technical Architecture (9:00-10:30)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "Technical Infrastructure"
- Architecture diagram:
  - **Layer 1:** Metadata (Protocol Buffers, JSON-LD)
  - **Layer 2:** Validation (Haskell, Python, Rust)
  - **Layer 3:** Consent Registry (API, database, audit logs)
  - **Layer 4:** Integration (CI/CD, scrapers, platforms)
- GitHub link: github.com/palimpsest-license

**Speaker Notes:**
> "How is this implemented? Four technical layers."
>
> "Layer 1: Metadata. We use Protocol Buffers and JSON-LD for machine-readable licence information. Compact, versioned, backwards-compatible."
>
> "Layer 2: Validation. Scrapers and platforms use validators—written in Haskell, Python, Rust—to check consent status. These validators query the consent registry."
>
> "Layer 3: Consent Registry. A centralised API that stores consent grants, denials, and requests. Think of it like a certificate authority for creative permissions."
>
> "Layer 4: Integration. We provide SDKs, CI/CD plugins (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), and documentation for scrapers, platforms, and tools."
>
> "All of this is open source. Visit github.com/palimpsest-license to explore the code."
>
> "Platform developers: You can integrate Palimpsest checks into your infrastructure."
>
> "AI companies: You can build ethical training pipelines that respect creator consent."
>
> "Creators: You can adopt the licence in 10 minutes."

**Timing:** 90 seconds (9:00-10:30)

---

#### Slide 9: Not DRM (10:30-11:45)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "Palimpsest ≠ DRM"
- Comparison table:
  | Feature | DRM | Palimpsest |
  |---------|-----|------------|
  | Technical restriction | ✓ (locks files) | ✗ (legal framework) |
  | User-hostile | ✓ (breaks accessibility) | ✗ (files stay open) |
  | Illegal to circumvent | ✓ (DMCA) | ✗ (enforced via copyright) |
  | Scope | Device control | AI training consent |
- Visual: DRM = locked gate, Palimpsest = "No Trespassing" sign

**Speaker Notes:**
> "I know what you're thinking: 'This sounds like DRM.'"
>
> "It's not. Let me be clear."
>
> "DRM—Digital Rights Management—uses technical restrictions to lock files. You can't open a DRM-protected eBook without special software. It's user-hostile. It breaks accessibility. It's illegal to circumvent under laws like the DMCA."
>
> "Palimpsest is different. It's a legal framework, not a technical lock."
>
> "Your files stay open. Anyone can read, view, remix them. Human use is unrestricted."
>
> "What requires consent is AI training—a specific, industrial-scale use."
>
> "Enforcement? Copyright law, like GPL or Creative Commons. If an AI company violates your licence, you sue—just like you would for GPL violation."
>
> "Palimpsest is a 'No Trespassing' sign, not a locked gate. It informs. It doesn't restrict access."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (10:30-11:45)

  - **Keiko (Photographer):** Midjourney paid £2,000 for 200 images

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Is this theoretical? No. It's happening now."
>
> "Over 10,000 creators have adopted Palimpsest in the past year."
>
> "We've processed 500+ consent requests through the registry."
>
> "Creators have collectively earned over £250,000 in compensation."
>
> "Three quick case studies:"
>
> "Maya, a digital artist, discovered her work in Stable Diffusion's training set. She adopted Palimpsest, sent a cease-and-desist, and Stability AI removed her work and paid £500."
>
> "James, a sci-fi author, was approached by OpenAI for GPT training. He negotiated £1,000 plus attribution in their model card."
>
> "Keiko, a photographer, licensed 200 images to Midjourney for £10 each—£2,000 total."
>
> "These are real creators, real compensation, real empowerment."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (11:45-13:00)

#### Slide 11: Platform & Regulatory Alignment (13:00-14:00)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "Adoption & Policy Alignment"
- Platform interest:
  - GitHub: Exploring Palimpsest integration
  - DeviantArt: Consent infrastructure pilot
  - Bandcamp: Metadata support discussions
- Regulatory alignment:
  - **EU AI Act (Article 53):** Requires training data transparency
  - **UK Copyright Consultation:** Considering consent frameworks
  - **US Fair Use Debate:** Legislative proposals pending
- Standards development:
  - W3C Community Group: Consent metadata standards
  - IETF Internet-Draft: HTTP extensions for licences

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Adoption is growing—both in platforms and policy."
>
> "GitHub is exploring Palimpsest integration. DeviantArt is piloting consent infrastructure. Bandcamp is in discussions about metadata support."
>
> "On the regulatory side, the EU AI Act—specifically Article 53—requires AI companies to identify and comply with copyright reservations. Palimpsest provides exactly that: machine-readable reservations."
>
> "The UK's copyright consultation is considering consent-based frameworks for AI training."
>
> "In the US, fair use for AI training is being debated in Congress."
>
> "And standards bodies are taking notice. The W3C has a Community Group developing consent metadata standards. The IETF has an Internet-Draft for HTTP extensions."
>
> "Palimpsest isn't just a grassroots movement. It's becoming infrastructure."

**Timing:** 60 seconds (13:00-14:00)

### PART 3: THE PATH FORWARD (14:00-19:00 / 300 seconds)

#### Slide 12: Vision for 2030 (14:00-15:15)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "The Consent Layer: 2025-2030"
- Timeline:
  - **2025:** 10,000 creators → 100,000 creators
  - **2026:** Platform integrations (GitHub, DeviantArt, Bandcamp)
  - **2027:** Regulatory mandates (EU, UK enforcement)
  - **2028:** AI companies adopt consent infrastructure (ethical advantage)
  - **2030:** Consent metadata ubiquitous (like HTTPS)

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Where are we headed?"
>
> "By 2030, I envision consent metadata being as ubiquitous as HTTPS."
>
> "Here's the roadmap:"
>
> "2025: We grow from 10,000 to 100,000 creators. Adoption accelerates as awareness spreads."
>
> "2026: Platforms integrate consent infrastructure. GitHub, DeviantArt, Bandcamp—creators can toggle 'Palimpsest protection' in settings."
>
> "2027: Regulators mandate compliance. The EU AI Act enforces Article 53. AI companies must respect consent metadata or face fines."
>
> "2028: Ethical AI companies see competitive advantage. 'We train on consented data' becomes a selling point."
>
> "2030: Consent metadata is default. You wouldn't publish a work without it—just like you wouldn't run a website without HTTPS."
>
> "This is the future: an internet where creators are protected, not exploited."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (14:00-15:15)

---

#### Slide 13: Challenges & Criticisms (15:15-16:30)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "Challenges We're Addressing"
- Table of criticisms and responses:
  | Criticism | Response |
  |-----------|----------|
  | "This fragments the internet" | Diversity ≠ fragmentation; creators choose |
  | "Consent is too burdensome" | Scalable infrastructure; API-driven |
  | "Small creators won't benefit" | Collective models (DAOs, unions) |
  | "AI will ignore it" | Legal enforcement + detection tools |

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Let me address criticisms."
>
> "First: 'This fragments the internet.' Our response: Fragmentation already exists—CC BY, GPL, proprietary. Palimpsest adds one option. That's diversity, not fragmentation."
>
> "Second: 'Consent is too burdensome for AI companies.' Our response: Is it more burdensome than billion-dollar lawsuits? We're building scalable infrastructure—query an API, get yes/no. It's no harder than OAuth."
>
> "Third: 'Small creators won't benefit.' Our response: Collective models help. DAOs, unions, guilds negotiate on behalf of creators. One poet earning £50 might seem small, but 1,000 poets earning £50,000 collectively? That's power."
>
> "Fourth: 'AI will ignore it.' Our response: Legal enforcement is real. Detection tools identify Palimpsest violations. And ethical AI companies want defensible datasets—consented data is legally safer."
>
> "We're not naive. We know adoption won't be instant. But change never is."

**Timing:** 75 seconds (15:15-16:30)

---

#### Slide 14: Call to Action (16:30-18:00)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "Join the Movement"
- Three paths:
  1. **Creators:** Adopt the licence (palimpsest.licence/adopt)
  2. **Platforms:** Integrate consent infrastructure (dev@palimpsest.licence)
  3. **Researchers/Developers:** Contribute to open-source tooling (github.com/palimpsest-license)
- QR code linking to website

**Speaker Notes:**
> "How can you help?"
>
> "If you're a creator—writer, artist, musician, developer—adopt the Palimpsest Licence. Visit palimpsest.licence/adopt. It takes 10 minutes."
>
> "If you're a platform developer—GitHub, DeviantArt, Bandcamp, Medium, Substack—integrate consent infrastructure. We have technical specs, SDKs, and business case analyses. Email dev@palimpsest.licence."
>
> "If you're a researcher or developer, contribute to the open-source tooling. We need validators in more languages, better UX, faster APIs. Join us on GitHub."
>
> "AI companies: Build ethically. Request consent. It's better for everyone—legally defensible, ethically sound, market-differentiating."
>
> "Policymakers: Endorse consent infrastructure. Don't mandate specific licences, but recognise consent-layer frameworks as best practice."
>
> "This is a collective effort. No single actor can build the consent layer alone. But together, we can."

**Timing:** 90 seconds (16:30-18:00)

---

#### Slide 15: Conclusion (18:00-19:00)

**Slide Content:**
- Title: "The Internet We Deserve"
- Quote: "The internet was built on sharing. But sharing without consent isn't collaboration—it's exploitation."
- Visual: Network of creators, platforms, AI companies, all connected through consent layer
- Final text: "Your Work. Your Consent. Your Rights."

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Let me close with this:"
>
> "The internet was built on sharing. Open protocols, open standards, open communities."
>
> "But sharing without consent isn't collaboration. It's exploitation."
>
> "AI has the potential to amplify human creativity—to help writers write, artists create, developers code faster."
>
> "But only if it's built ethically. Only if creators are partners, not resources to be extracted."
>
> "Palimpsest offers a path forward: a consent layer that protects creators while enabling innovation."
>
> "By 2030, I want to look back and say: We built the internet we deserved. Where creators are empowered. Where AI is ethical. Where consent is infrastructure."
>
> "That's the world Palimpsest is building. Join us."

**Timing:** 60 seconds (18:00-19:00)

## Q&A Preparation (Post-Presentation)

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

#### Q1: "How is this different from Creative Commons Non-Commercial?"

**Answer:**
> "Good question. CC NC prohibits commercial use entirely—including by humans. Palimpsest allows commercial use for human purposes (reading, sharing, performing) but requires consent for AI training specifically. It's more targeted. Also, CC NC has ambiguous definitions of 'commercial'—Palimpsest is explicit about AI training."

---

#### Q2: "Won't AI companies just ignore this licence?"

**Answer:**
> "Three reasons they won't: First, legal risk. Getty, Authors Guild lawsuits show AI companies face real liability. Palimpsest provides a clear 'do not use' signal—harder to claim ignorance. Second, ethical AI companies want defensible datasets. Consented data is safer. Third, regulation. The EU AI Act requires compliance with copyright reservations. Ignoring Palimpsest means fines."

---

#### Q3: "How do you verify consent at scale? There are billions of works online."

**Answer:**
> "Scalable infrastructure. The Consent Registry is an API—query it with a creator identifier and use case, get yes/no. It's no slower than DNS lookups or HTTPS certificate checks. We also cache consent decisions—once a creator grants consent to OpenAI for GPT training, all OpenAI requests get cached 'yes.' Fast, efficient, scalable."

---

#### Q4: "What about works already in training datasets?"

**Answer:**
> "Palimpsest protects going forward. For retroactive use, creators can request disclosure under transparency laws (like GDPR or EU AI Act), then negotiate compensation or sue. Some companies—Stability AI, for example—offer opt-out mechanisms for future model versions. It's not perfect, but it's progress."

---

#### Q5: "Can this work with open-source licences like GPL?"

**Answer:**
> "Absolutely. Dual licensing is common. Use GPL for your code (ensures open-source derivatives) and Palimpsest for documentation, assets, or creative elements. Or use Palimpsest for everything—it doesn't conflict with GPL's copyleft principles, just adds AI-specific consent requirements."

---

#### Q6: "Who funds the Consent Registry? Is it sustainable?"

**Answer:**
> "The registry is funded through a combination of grants, platform partnerships, and small fees for high-volume AI companies (e.g., £0.001 per consent check for commercial use). Individual creators always use it free. It's designed to be sustainable and open-source—others can run their own instances if needed."
