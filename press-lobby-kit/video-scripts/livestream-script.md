### SEGMENT 1: INTRODUCTION & PANEL INTROS (0:00-0:15 / 15 minutes)

#### Opening (0:00-0:05)

**Moderator:**
> "Good [morning/afternoon/evening], everyone! Welcome to 'The Future of Creative Licensing in the AI Era,' a Palimpsest panel discussion."
>
> "I'm [Name], your moderator for today. We're thrilled you're here—whether you're a creator, developer, lawyer, AI researcher, or just curious about how technology is reshaping creative rights."
>
> "Over the next 90 minutes, we'll explore a critical question: How can creators protect their work in the age of AI training? And what role does licensing—specifically the Palimpsest Licence—play in building a fairer internet?"
>
> "We have an incredible panel today. Let me introduce them."

**Visual:** Moderator centre-screen, panellists in grid

---

#### Panellist Introductions (0:05-0:15)

**Moderator introduces each panellist (1-2 minutes each):**

**Example:**

> "First, we have [Creator Name], [title/description]. [Creator] is a [discipline] who adopted the Palimpsest Licence after discovering their work in AI training datasets. Welcome, [Creator]!"

**Panellist:** 30-second self-intro (who they are, why they care about this topic)

**Repeat for all panellists.**

---

### SEGMENT 2: THE PROBLEM - AI TRAINING & CREATOR HARMS (0:15-0:35 / 20 minutes)

#### Moderator Opening (0:15-0:17)

**Moderator:**
> "Let's start with the problem. AI training—GPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion—operates at massive scale, using billions of works from the internet. Creators often don't know their work is being used, and they certainly haven't consented."
>
> "[Creator Panellist], you've experienced this firsthand. Can you share your story?"

---

#### Creator Panellist: Personal Experience (0:17-0:22)

**Creator Panellist:**
> "Absolutely. I'm a digital artist, and last year I discovered my artwork in Stable Diffusion's training dataset—via a tool called Have I Been Trained. Thousands of my images, used without permission."
>
> "I never consented. I never got paid. And seeing AI generate work 'in my style'—that felt like erasure. My voice, blended with thousands of others, anonymised."
>
> "That's when I found Palimpsest. It gave me a way to say: 'No more.'"

**Moderator:**
> "Thank you for sharing that. [Legal Panellist], from a legal standpoint, is this permissible? Can AI companies just scrape and train without consent?"

---

#### Legal Panellist: Legal Landscape (0:22-0:28)

**Legal Panellist:**
> "It's a grey area. Courts haven't definitively ruled on whether AI training is fair use or copyright infringement. We have pending cases—Getty v Stability AI, Authors Guild v OpenAI—but no final judgments."
>
> "AI companies argue 'transformative use'—training isn't the same as redistribution. But creators counter: it's commercial, it's large-scale, and it replaces human creators."
>
> "Until courts decide, creators are in limbo. That's why proactive licensing—like Palimpsest—matters. It creates a clear legal framework."

**Moderator:**
> "[AI Panellist], you work in AI research. How do you see this from the AI development side?"

---

#### AI Panellist: AI Perspective (0:28-0:35)

**AI Panellist:**
> "From a technical standpoint, AI training requires massive datasets. The default has been 'scrape everything publicly available.'"
>
> "But I think we're realising that's ethically problematic. Just because something is public doesn't mean it's ethically available for commercial AI training."
>
> "Ethical AI companies—like Anthropic, where I work—are exploring consent-based datasets. We want training data we can defend—legally and ethically."
>
> "Palimpsest-style metadata makes that feasible. We can check: 'Does this creator consent?' If not, we don't use it."

**Moderator:**
> "So consent infrastructure is technically feasible?"

**AI Panellist:**
> "Absolutely. It's a solved problem technically. The challenge is adoption and coordination."

---

### SEGMENT 3: THE SOLUTION - PALIMPSEST LICENCE (0:35-0:60 / 25 minutes)

#### Moderator Transition (0:35-0:37)

**Moderator:**
> "That brings us to the Palimpsest Licence. [Platform Panellist], you've been exploring integration at [Platform]. Can you explain what Palimpsest does?"

---

#### Platform Panellist: What is Palimpsest? (0:37-0:43)

**Platform Panellist:**
> "Sure. Palimpsest is a licensing framework that distinguishes between human use and AI training."
>
> "Human use—reading, sharing, remixing—remains free. But AI training requires explicit creator consent."
>
> "Technically, it works through machine-readable metadata. A creator adds a licence file to their repository or website. AI scrapers detect it and check a consent registry: 'Has this creator granted permission?'"
>
> "If yes, they proceed. If no, they don't use the work."
>
> "From a platform perspective, this is powerful. We can offer creators control without restricting human access."

**Moderator:**
> "[Creator Panellist], you've adopted Palimpsest. How has it worked for you?"

---

#### Creator Panellist: Adoption Experience (0:43-0:48)

**Creator Panellist:**
> "It was straightforward. I downloaded the licence file, added it to my GitHub and portfolio website. Took maybe 15 minutes."
>
> "Within weeks, I received a consent request from Stability AI—likely because I'd sent a cease-and-desist earlier. They offered £500 to remove my work from future training."
>
> "I accepted. It wasn't life-changing money, but it was recognition. My work has value. I have control."
>
> "Since then, I've recommended Palimpsest to every creator I know."

**Moderator:**
> "[Legal Panellist], how does Palimpsest fit within existing copyright law?"

---

#### Legal Panellist: Legal Framework (0:48-0:54)

**Legal Panellist:**
> "Palimpsest builds on established copyright principles. Just like GPL or Creative Commons, it's a licence—a legal agreement about how works can be used."
>
> "The innovation is the specificity: 'AI training requires consent.' That's not in CC or GPL, because they predate large-scale AI."
>
> "Legally, it's enforceable the same way any licence is. If an AI company violates it, the creator can sue for copyright infringement."
>
> "And importantly, Palimpsest aligns with emerging regulations—like the EU AI Act Article 53, which requires AI companies to respect copyright reservations. Palimpsest provides exactly that."

**Moderator:**
> "[Policymaker Panellist], speaking of regulation—where do you see this headed?"

---

#### Policymaker Panellist: Regulatory Trends (0:54-0:60)

**Policymaker Panellist:**
> "The EU AI Act is a watershed moment. Article 53 mandates that AI companies must 'identify and comply with copyright reservations.' That includes licences like Palimpsest."
>
> "We're also seeing movement in the UK—copyright consultations are considering consent frameworks. The US is debating fair use for AI in Congress."
>
> "Regulation won't solve everything, but it creates incentives. AI companies that respect consent get regulatory compliance. Those that don't face fines."
>
> "I think consent infrastructure—whether Palimpsest or similar frameworks—will become standard practice by 2030."

**Moderator:**
> "So we're seeing alignment across tech, law, and policy. [AI Panellist], what needs to happen for AI companies to widely adopt consent checks?"

---

#### AI Panellist: Adoption Barriers & Solutions (0:60-0:65)

**AI Panellist:**
> "Three things need to happen."
>
> "First: Standards. We need agreed-upon metadata formats. Palimpsest uses Protocol Buffers and JSON-LD, which is great. We need W3C or IETF to formalise this."
>
> "Second: Tooling. AI companies need easy-to-integrate validators. If checking consent is as simple as a pip install or npm package, adoption accelerates."
>
> "Third: Incentives. Legal risk is one incentive. But ethical branding is another—'We train on consented data' is a competitive advantage."
>
> "The good news: All three are happening. Standards are in development. Tooling exists. And ethical AI is becoming mainstream."

---

### SEGMENT 4: CHALLENGES & DEBATE (0:65-0:90 / 25 minutes)

#### Moderator Transition (0:65-0:66)

**Moderator:**
> "Let's dig into challenges and criticisms. [Platform Panellist], one common objection is: 'This fragments the internet.' How do you respond?"

---

#### Platform Panellist: Fragmentation Concern (0:66-0:70)

**Platform Panellist:**
> "I'd say fragmentation already exists—and it's healthy. We have CC BY, CC BY-SA, GPL, MIT, proprietary licences. Creators choose what fits their needs."
>
> "Palimpsest adds one more option. That's diversity, not fragmentation."
>
> "From a platform perspective, supporting multiple licences is part of our value proposition. Creators want control. We provide tools."
>
> "And metadata standards make this scalable. If all licences use machine-readable formats, platforms can automatically respect them."

**Moderator:**
> "[Legal Panellist], another concern: enforceability. How do creators prove AI companies violated their licence?"

---

#### Legal Panellist: Enforcement Challenges (0:70-0:75)

**Legal Panellist:**
> "Enforcement is a real challenge. Proving your work was in a training dataset isn't trivial."
>
> "But we're seeing progress. Tools like 'Have I Been Trained' let creators search datasets. Memorisation tests can detect if a model reproduced specific works."
>
> "And the EU AI Act requires transparency. AI companies must disclose training data sources. That creates an audit trail."
>
> "Legal precedent will help too. Once the first Palimpsest case goes to court and wins, it sets a precedent. Other companies take notice."

**Moderator:**
> "[Creator Panellist], some say 'small creators won't benefit from individual consent requests.' What's your take?"

---

#### Creator Panellist: Collective Models (0:75-0:80)

**Creator Panellist:**
> "Individually, maybe I'd only earn £50 from an AI company. But collectively? That's where power lies."
>
> "Imagine a DAO or guild of 10,000 artists. We negotiate as a group. AI companies want access? They pay a collective fee—split among members."
>
> "Palimpsest supports this. The licence allows creators to delegate consent to a collective. So small creators aren't navigating alone."

**Moderator:**
> "[AI Panellist], final challenge: some say 'AI will train on Palimpsest-licensed works anyway and just not disclose it.' How do you respond?"

---

#### AI Panellist: Unauthorised Use (0:80-0:85)

**AI Panellist:**
> "That's a risk with any law or licence. People violate copyright, GPL, speed limits—doesn't mean we abandon rules."
>
> "Detection is improving. Watermarking, memorisation analysis, dataset audits—we can identify violations."
>
> "And ethical AI companies gain by respecting licences. Trust is a competitive advantage. If we're caught violating Palimpsest, we lose credibility."
>
> "I think the incentive structure aligns. Most companies will comply."

**Moderator:**
> "Strong points from all of you. Let's open this up to the audience."

---

### SEGMENT 5: AUDIENCE Q&A (0:90-1:30 / 40 minutes)

#### Moderator Instructions (0:90-0:92)

**Moderator:**
> "We have time for audience questions. Drop your questions in the chat or the Q&A box. I'll read them aloud and direct them to our panellists."
>
> "Let's start with this one from [Username]…"

---

#### Sample Audience Questions & Panel Responses

**Q1: "How does Palimpsest work with open-source software? Can I use GPL and Palimpsest together?"**

**Legal Panellist:**
> "Great question. Yes, you can dual-licence. Use GPL for your code (ensures derivatives are open-source) and Palimpsest for documentation or creative assets. They're compatible—both are copyright licences with different focuses."

---

**Q2: "What if an AI company is based in a country that doesn't recognise copyright?"**

**Legal Panellist:**
> "Copyright is global under the Berne Convention. If a company sells products in the EU, UK, or US, they're subject to those jurisdictions. So even if based elsewhere, they face legal risk."

---

**Q3: "I'm a musician. How do I add Palimpsest metadata to my audio files?"**

**Creator Panellist:**
> "Use ID3 tags for MP3 files or metadata fields for other formats. Add your licence info in the 'Comment' or 'Copyright' field. Tools like MP3Tag make this easy. We also have a tutorial on palimpsest.licence."

---

**Q4: "Will platforms like Spotify or SoundCloud integrate Palimpsest?"**

**Platform Panellist:**
> "We're in discussions with several streaming platforms. The challenge is metadata preservation—some platforms strip metadata on upload. But there's growing interest. Platforms want to protect creators and avoid legal risk."

---

**Q5: "How can I contribute to Palimpsest development? I'm a developer."**

**AI/Platform Panellist:**
> "Visit github.com/palimpsest-license. We have open-source validators, SDKs, and CI/CD tools. We need contributors for more languages, better UX, and documentation. Join our Discord too—link on the website."

---

**Q6: "Is there a way to grant consent for non-commercial AI research but deny for commercial use?"**

**Legal Panellist:**
> "Yes, Palimpsest supports fine-grained consent. You can specify: 'Academic research: yes. Commercial training: no.' It's in the metadata schema."

---

**Q7: "What happens if I change my mind after granting consent?"**

**Creator Panellist:**
> "Consent can include terms—like 'valid for 1 year' or 'revocable with 30 days notice.' It's a negotiation. If you revoke, the AI company should stop using your work in future models."

---

**Q8: "How do you verify that AI companies actually check the consent registry?"**

**AI Panellist:**
> "Transparency requirements help. Under the EU AI Act, companies must disclose datasets. If they claim compliance but violated Palimpsest, audits will catch it. Plus, ethical AI companies publish compliance reports."

---

#### Continue Q&A (0:92-1:25)

**Moderator:** Continue fielding questions, balancing panellists (ensure all get chances to respond)

**Panellists:** Engage with chat (react to questions, thank askers)

---

### SEGMENT 6: CLOSING STATEMENTS (1:25-1:30 / 5 minutes)

#### Moderator Prompts (1:25-1:26)

**Moderator:**
> "We're approaching the end of our time. I'd like each panellist to share a brief closing thought. [Creator Panellist], let's start with you. What's your message to creators watching?"

---

#### Creator Panellist Closing (1:26-1:27)

**Creator Panellist:**
> "Protect your work. You have power. Palimpsest is one tool—but the larger message is: Don't let AI companies decide for you. Your consent matters."

---

#### Platform Panellist Closing (1:27-1:28)

**Platform Panellist:**
> "To platform developers: Integrate consent infrastructure. It's good for users, good for business, good for the internet."

---

#### Legal Panellist Closing (1:28-1:29)

**Legal Panellist:**
> "The law is catching up. Creators have rights. Palimpsest makes those rights enforceable. Use it."

---

#### AI Panellist Closing (1:29-1:30)

**AI Panellist:**
> "Ethical AI is possible. But only if we respect creators. Consent infrastructure is the path forward."

---

#### Policymaker Panellist Closing (1:30)

**Policymaker Panellist:**
> "Regulation will support consent frameworks. But don't wait for regulation—act now."

---

#### Moderator Final Closing (1:30)

**Moderator:**
> "Thank you to our incredible panellists—[names]. Thank you to everyone who joined live."
>
