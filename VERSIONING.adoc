= PMPL Versioning Policy
:toc:

== Purpose

This document defines how new versions of the Palimpsest‑MPL License (PMPL) are created, reviewed, approved, and published.

== Version Format

PMPL uses semantic versioning:

----
MAJOR.MINOR
----

Examples:

* `1.0` — initial release
* `1.1` — clarifications, non‑substantive improvements
* `2.0` — substantive legal or structural changes

== “‑or‑later” Model

The canonical SPDX identifier is:

----
PMPL-1.0-or-later
----

This grants recipients the option to use:

* the version under which the work was originally licensed, or
* any later version published by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council

== Release Types

=== Minor Versions (e.g., 1.1)
* clarifications
* improved definitions
* non‑substantive refinements
* updated exhibits

=== Major Versions (e.g., 2.0)
* substantive legal changes
* new obligations
* new rights
* structural changes to exhibits

== Release Process

. Proposal submitted via GitHub issue
. Council review
. Public comment period (minimum 30 days)
. Council vote (2/3 supermajority for major versions)
. Publication of:
* updated license text
* changelog
* SPDX metadata
* legal commentary

== Historical Versions

All previous versions are stored under:

----
legal/historical/
----

== Deprecation

The Council may deprecate versions but cannot revoke them.
