= PMPL Versioning Policy
:toc:

== Purpose

This document defines how new versions of the Palimpsest-MPL License (PMPL) are created, reviewed, approved, and published.

== Version Format

PMPL uses semantic versioning:

----
MAJOR.MINOR
----

Examples:

* `1.0` - initial release
* `1.1` - clarifications, non-substantive improvements
* `2.0` - substantive legal or structural changes

== Current Canonical Version

The current legal text is:

* **Palimpsest-MPL License 1.0** (PMPL-1.0)

The canonical SPDX identifier for new work is:

----
PMPL-1.0-or-later
----

Use **PMPL-1.0-or-later** in file headers and metadata. The license text itself
remains the PMPL-1.0 legal text.

== "-or-later" Model

The canonical SPDX identifier is:

----
PMPL-1.0-or-later
----

This grants recipients the option to use:

* the version under which the work was originally licensed, or
* any later version published by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council

== Badge Versioning

Badges should display the legal version explicitly (e.g., *Palimpsest License v1.0*)
and align with **PMPL-1.0-or-later** in SPDX metadata. Avoid legacy *v0.x* badge
labels for new work.

== Legacy References

Historical materials may reference *v0.x* for archival or research purposes. Those
references are legacy and do not indicate the current legal version.

== Release Types

=== Minor Versions (e.g., 1.1)
* clarifications
* improved definitions
* non-substantive refinements
* updated exhibits

=== Major Versions (e.g., 2.0)
* substantive legal changes
* new obligations
* new rights
* structural changes to exhibits

== Release Process

. Proposal submitted via GitHub issue
. Council review
. Public comment period (minimum 30 days)
. Council vote (2/3 supermajority for major versions)
. Publication of:
* updated license text
* changelog
* SPDX metadata
* legal commentary

== Historical Versions

All previous versions are stored under:

----
legal/historical/
----

== Deprecation

The Council may deprecate versions but cannot revoke them.
