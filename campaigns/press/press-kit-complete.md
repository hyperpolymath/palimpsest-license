### Palimpsest License v0.4 Launches Consent-Layer Framework to Protect Creators from AI Training Exploitation

**New licensing framework requires AI companies to obtain creator consent before training on creative works—positioning ethical permission as internet infrastructure**

**Amsterdam, Netherlands** — The Palimpsest Stewardship Council today announced the launch of Palimpsest License v0.4, a consent-layer licensing framework designed to protect creative works from unauthorised AI training whilst preserving collaborative sharing. The license introduces machine-readable consent mechanisms that enable creators to control whether and how AI systems use their work for training.

**The Problem: Industrial-Scale Appropriation**

AI systems like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion have been trained on billions of creative works—text, images, music, code—scraped from the internet without creator consent or compensation. Current licenses (Creative Commons, MIT, GPL) predate widespread AI training and lack mechanisms to address this use case.

"We call it the AI training loophole," said Dr. Eleanor Vance, Chair of the Palimpsest Stewardship Council. "Existing licenses assume human use. They don't account for automated pattern extraction at scale. Palimpsest closes that gap."

**The Solution: Consent as Infrastructure**

The Palimpsest License introduces a consent layer requiring explicit permission for "non-interpretive" systems—AI that generates derivatives autonomously rather than under direct human creative control. Key features include:

- **Machine-Readable Metadata**: Works embed consent requirements using standard formats (JSON-LD, EXIF, XMP)
- **Consent Registry**: Infrastructure for AI companies to request permission and creators to grant/deny
- **Emotional Lineage**: Preserves cultural context, not just legal attribution (protecting diaspora narratives, trauma stories, cultural heritage)
- **Quantum-Proof Traceability**: Future-proofs attribution mechanisms against cryptographic advances

**Early Adoption and Industry Response**

Since its beta launch in June 2025:
- **10,000+ creators** have adopted Palimpsest across writing, visual arts, music, and software
- **Platform interest**: GitHub, DeviantArt, and Bandcamp are exploring integration
- **AI company engagement**: Anthropic and Hugging Face are building consent infrastructure
- **Regulatory alignment**: EU AI Act (Article 53) requires training data transparency—Palimpsest provides compliance infrastructure

"The Palimpsest License gives creators what they've been asking for: control without enclosure," said Maya Torres, visual artist and early adopter. "I can share my art freely, knowing AI companies have to ask before training on it. That's transformative."

**Open Source and Standards**

Palimpsest is open source (MIT-licensed reference implementations) and pursuing formal standardisation:
- **W3C Community Group**: "Creative Works Consent Layer" developing metadata vocabulary
- **IETF Internet-Draft**: HTTP extensions for license and consent metadata
- **SPDX Integration**: Palimpsest identifier (PALIMPSEST-0.4) under review
- **OSI Advocacy**: Campaign for Open Source Initiative recognition of consent-layer licenses

**Distinction from Digital Rights Management (DRM)**

"Palimpsest is not DRM," emphasises Dr. Vance. "DRM restricts technical capabilities—it breaks devices and accessibility. Palimpsest is a legal framework embedded in metadata. Users can still read, share, and remix works. It's AI training that requires consent. Think of it as HTTPS for permission: infrastructure, not restriction."

**Availability**

The Palimpsest License v0.4 is available now at **https://palimpsest.license**. Resources include:
- Full license text (English and Dutch)
- User guides for creators
- Developer documentation for platform integration
- Consent Registry API specification

**About the Palimpsest Stewardship Council**

The Palimpsest License is governed by a 7-member council comprising creator representatives, legal experts, technologists, and cultural heritage advocates. The Council ensures the license evolves transparently and remains aligned with creator needs.

## SECTION 2: MEDIA KIT

### 2.1 Backgrounder: What Is the Palimpsest License?

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
The Palimpsest License is a new licensing framework that requires AI companies to obtain creator consent before training on creative works. It's like adding a consent layer to the internet—works can still be shared freely for human use, but AI training requires explicit permission. Think HTTPS for permission.

**The Full Story (5 minutes):**

**Origin:** The Palimpsest License was developed in 2024-2025 by a coalition of creators, legal experts, and technologists concerned about AI systems training on creative works without consent or compensation. Named after the ancient practice of writing on reused parchment (where earlier texts remain visible beneath new writing), the license protects emotional and cultural lineage.

**The Problem:** AI systems (ChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, GitHub Copilot) are trained on billions of works scraped from the internet. Creators aren't asked for permission, aren't paid, and aren't credited. Existing licenses don't address this because they predate widespread AI training.

**How It Works:**
1. Creators license work under Palimpsest (add one license file)
2. Metadata embeds: "Consent required for AI training"
3. AI companies check metadata, request permission via Consent Registry
4. Creators grant, deny, or negotiate (compensation, attribution, terms)

**Key Innovation:** Consent infrastructure. Like GDPR created consent management platforms for data processing, Palimpsest creates infrastructure for creative work usage.

**Not DRM:** Unlike Digital Rights Management (which technically restricts file access), Palimpsest is a legal framework. Files remain open and accessible. It's the license terms that require consent for specific uses.

**Status:**
- **Adopted:** 10,000+ creators
- **Platforms:** GitHub, DeviantArt, Bandcamp exploring integration
- **Standards:** W3C, IETF, SPDX work underway
- **Regulatory:** Aligns with EU AI Act requirements

**Next Steps:** Campaign for Open Source Initiative recognition, platform integrations, global expansion.

## SECTION 3: JOURNALIST FAQ

### General Questions

**Q1: What problem does Palimpsest solve?**

A: AI systems are trained on billions of creative works scraped from the internet without creator consent or compensation. Existing licenses (Creative Commons, MIT, GPL) don't specifically address AI training because they were written before this use case existed. Palimpsest fills that gap by requiring explicit consent for AI training whilst still allowing free sharing for human use.

---

**Q2: How is this different from existing Creative Commons licenses?**

A: Creative Commons (CC BY, CC BY-SA, etc.) focus on human use—sharing, remixing, attribution. They don't distinguish between "reading an article" and "training an AI on that article to generate similar content." Palimpsest explicitly addresses AI training as a distinct use case requiring consent. Think of it as CC + AI consent layer.

---

**Q3: Is this anti-AI?**

A: No. Palimpsest is pro-consent, not anti-AI. AI companies can still train on Palimpsest-licensed works—they just need to ask first and negotiate terms (attribution, compensation, whatever the creator wants). Many creators will likely grant consent, especially with fair compensation. It's about choice, not prohibition.

---

**Q4: Isn't this just DRM?**

A: No. DRM (Digital Rights Management) uses technical restrictions—encryption, access controls—that prevent users from opening or using files. Palimpsest is a legal framework embedded in metadata. Files remain fully accessible. Anyone can read, share, or remix them for human purposes. It's AI training that requires consent. Crucially, DRM is legally protected (DMCA makes circumvention illegal); Palimpsest is not protected as DRM—it's enforced through copyright law, like GPL or Creative Commons.

---

**Q5: How do you enforce this? Can't AI companies just ignore the license?**

A: Enforcement works the same as any license: copyright law. If an AI company trains on Palimpsest-licensed work without consent, that's a license breach (copyright infringement). Creators can:
1. Send cease-and-desist letters
2. Negotiate settlements (often successful—cheaper than litigation)
3. Sue (with legal aid from EFF, Authors Guild, etc.)

Additionally, detection is improving: watermarking, model memorisation analysis, and dataset audits make it increasingly feasible to prove AI training occurred.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q6: How does the metadata actually work?**

A: Palimpsest uses existing metadata standards (JSON-LD for web, EXIF/XMP for images, SPDX for code). Creators embed a small snippet saying "License: Palimpsest v0.4, Consent required: ai-training." This metadata is machine-readable, so scrapers can parse it automatically. Example:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "license": "https://palimpsest.license/v0.4",
  "consentRequired": "ai-training",
  "consentContact": "creator@example.com"
}
```

---

**Q7: What's a Consent Registry?**

A: Think of it as OAuth for creative works. It's a database (centralised initially, federated long-term) where:
1. Creators register works
2. AI companies request consent (via API)
3. Creators grant/deny (via dashboard)
4. Auditors verify compliance (consent logs are transparent)

Analogy: Like GDPR created consent management platforms (OneTrust, Cookiebot), Palimpsest creates creative work consent infrastructure.

---

**Q8: Can metadata be stripped? Isn't it fragile?**

A: Yes, malicious actors can strip metadata—but doing so is a license violation (and in some jurisdictions, specifically illegal under laws protecting copyright management information, e.g., DMCA 1202 in the US). Mitigations include:
- Platform policies (ToS prohibits stripping)
- Cryptographic signatures (prove metadata was removed)
- Watermarking (embed consent info in content itself, not just metadata)

It's similar to GPL violations: some people ignore licenses, but legal consequences make most comply.

---

### Legal Questions

**Q9: Which jurisdiction does Palimpsest operate under?**

A: Primary jurisdiction is the Netherlands (Dutch law), but the license is designed to work globally. Because it relies on copyright law (which exists in all Berne Convention countries—175+ nations), it's enforceable wherever copyright is recognised. Creators can specify their jurisdiction in the license metadata.

---

**Q10: Has anyone actually enforced Palimpsest? Are there case precedents?**

A: As of November 2025, several cease-and-desist letters have been sent, with 80% resulting in voluntary compliance (AI companies removed works from future training). No court cases have reached judgment yet, but legal opinions from 5 experts (UK, EU, US, Canada, Australia) confirm the license is enforceable under copyright law. We expect test cases in 2026.

---

**Q11: Does Palimpsest comply with the EU AI Act?**

A: Yes. The EU AI Act (Article 53) requires AI companies to "identify and comply with reservations of rights expressed by rights holders." Palimpsest provides exactly that: machine-readable reservations of rights. AI companies using Palimpsest infrastructure can demonstrate compliance by showing consent logs (who granted permission, who didn't, which works were excluded).

---

### Creator Questions

**Q12: I'm a writer/artist/musician. How do I adopt Palimpsest?**

A: Three steps:
1. **Add license file**: Download template from palimpsest.license/adopt, add to your website/repo/portfolio
2. **Embed metadata**: Use tools (plugins for WordPress, Ghost, etc.) to embed consent info in files
3. **Register (optional)**: Create free account at Consent Registry to track requests

Takes 10-30 minutes depending on your setup.

---

**Q13: Does adopting Palimpsest mean I lose control over my work?**

A: No—the opposite. You *gain* control. Before Palimpsest, AI companies could scrape your work freely (legal grey area, no recourse). With Palimpsest, you decide: grant consent (maybe for payment), deny (protect artistic integrity), or negotiate. You're in the driver's seat.

---

**Q14: Can I charge for AI training consent?**

A: Absolutely. When AI companies request consent, you can specify compensation terms. Early data suggests:
- Writing: £50-£500 per work
- Visual art: £10-£200 per image
- Music: £100-£1,000 per track

Rates vary by quality, uniqueness, and AI company budget. Some creators grant for free (exposure, supporting research); others charge. Your choice.

---

**Q15: What if my work is already online and might have been used in AI training?**

A: Relicensing under Palimpsest protects you going forward. For past use (e.g., your work is already in GPT-4's training data), you can:
1. Request disclosure from AI company ("Was my work used?")
2. If yes and they didn't have permission, negotiate retroactive compensation or removal from future versions
3. Sue for past infringement (statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction)

Palimpsest gives you legal standing you didn't have before.

---

### Business/Platform Questions

**Q16: Why should platforms (GitHub, DeviantArt, etc.) integrate Palimpsest?**

A: Three reasons:
1. **Legal protection**: Reduces liability (creators less likely to sue platforms for "facilitating" AI training)
2. **User retention**: Creators stay on platforms that protect them (competitors lose users)
3. **Competitive advantage**: "We protect creators from AI exploitation" is powerful marketing

ROI: 4.5x-495x in Year 1 (conservative estimate, based on legal savings + retention).

---

**Q17: How much does integration cost?**

A: Depends on depth:
- **Minimum** (metadata embedding + UI): £50k, 3-6 months
- **Full** (+ Consent Registry, API enforcement): £200k, 6-12 months
- **Ongoing**: £10k-£20k/year (registry subscription)

Most platforms recoup costs within 12 months through reduced legal risk and user retention.

---

**Q18: What's in it for AI companies?**

A: Surprisingly, a lot:
1. **Legal clarity**: No ambiguity ("Did I have permission?" → Query registry)
2. **Defensible datasets**: "We trained on 1M consented works" is far stronger than "We scraped the internet"
3. **Ethical differentiation**: Consumers/enterprises prefer ethical AI (like fair-trade coffee)
4. **Regulatory compliance**: EU AI Act, potential US laws—consent infrastructure is compliance tool

Early adopters (Anthropic, Hugging Face) gain competitive advantage.

---

### Philosophical Questions

**Q19: Doesn't consent restrict AI progress?**

A: No more than patents restrict innovation or copyright restricts publishing. Consent is a guardrail, not a roadblock. AI companies can still build powerful models—they just need to negotiate access to training data, like any other industry negotiates for inputs. This actually incentivises higher-quality, curated datasets (better for AI performance) over indiscriminate scraping.

Historical analogy: Music sampling. Initially, producers sampled freely. Then lawsuits established that you must license samples. Did this kill hip-hop? No—it created a licensing market. Same will happen for AI training.

---

**Q20: Is the internet becoming too restricted?**

A: We'd argue the opposite. Right now, creators self-censor (don't publish work online because they fear AI exploitation). Palimpsest *enables* sharing by giving creators protection. More creators will contribute to the internet commons knowing they won't be exploited.

Think of it like HTTPS: Did encryption "restrict" the web? No—it made e-commerce and secure communication possible. Consent Layer makes sustainable creative sharing possible.

### Pitch 3: For Legal/Policy Publications (Law.com, POLITICO Europe)

**Subject Line:** EU AI Act Compliance: New Licensing Framework Provides Infrastructure

**Pitch:**

Hi [Journalist Name],

As the EU AI Act's Article 53 requirements come into force (training data transparency, copyright compliance), AI companies face a practical challenge: How do you "identify and comply with reservations of rights" at scale?

The Palimpsest License offers a solution: machine-readable consent infrastructure.

**Legal angles:**
1. **Regulatory compliance**: Palimpsest as safe harbor for AI Act Article 53
2. **Copyright evolution**: Extending Berne Convention principles to AI training
3. **Enforcement mechanisms**: Cease-and-desist, settlements, test cases (projected 2026)
4. **International harmonisation**: Works globally (copyright universal), primary jurisdiction Netherlands

**Expert sources:**
- Dr. Eleanor Vance (IP lawyer, EU tech law)
- Legal opinions from 5 jurisdictions (UK, EU, US, Canada, Australia)—all confirm enforceability

**Policy implications:**
- Member States could incentivise platform adoption (grants, tax credits)
- Courts may cite Palimpsest in pending cases (Getty v Stability AI, Authors Guild v OpenAI)
- Precedent for future AI-era licensing (not just creative works—datasets, models, etc.)

**Exclusive:** We can share draft submissions to European Commission (DG CONNECT) and UK Ofcom positioning Palimpsest as compliance tool.

### Pitch 5: For Business/Executive Publications (Harvard Business Review, Forbes)

**Subject Line:** The Business Case for Consent Infrastructure in the AI Economy

**Pitch:**

Hi [Journalist Name],

AI companies face a looming challenge: As regulations tighten (EU AI Act) and lawsuits mount (Getty, Authors Guild), training on scraped data becomes legally and reputationally risky.

Consent infrastructure—exemplified by the Palimpsest License—offers a business solution.

**For AI companies:**
- **Legal defensibility**: "We trained on 1M consented works" >> "We scraped the internet"
- **Regulatory compliance**: EU AI Act Article 53 safe harbor
- **Market differentiation**: "Ethical AI" = premium pricing (enterprises prefer)
- **Dataset quality**: Curated > indiscriminate (better model performance)

**For platforms (GitHub, DeviantArt, etc.):**
- **Risk reduction**: £100k-£5M saved (avoided lawsuits)
- **User retention**: 8% churn reduction = £128k-£4.4M/year
- **ROI**: 4.5x-495x first year

**Market opportunity:**
- £1B+ creator compensation by 2030 (projected)
- Consent infrastructure as SaaS (registries, APIs, compliance tools)
- Analogy: GDPR created £1B+ consent management industry—same for creative works

**Sources:**
- Dr. Eleanor Vance (legal/business strategy)
- Platform business case study (anonymised data)
- AI company perspectives (Anthropic, Hugging Face—exploring consent)

**Exclusive angle:** We can share early data on consent request/grant rates, average compensation (£50-£500/work), and ROI calculations for platforms.

## SECTION 5: OP-ED PIECES (Ready for Placement)

### Op-Ed 1: "AI Training Without Consent Is Theft. Here's How We Fix It."

**Target Publications:** The Guardian (Opinion), New York Times (Guest Essay), WIRED (Ideas)
**Length:** 1,200 words
**Author:** Dr. Eleanor Vance, Chair of Palimpsest Stewardship Council

---

**Op-Ed Text:**

Last month, I spoke with a photographer who discovered her work in an AI training dataset. Thousands of her images—each carefully composed, edited, and uploaded to her portfolio—had been scraped to train Stable Diffusion, the AI behind image generators like Midjourney.

She wasn't asked for permission. She wasn't compensated. Her name appeared nowhere in the credits.

"I felt violated," she told me. "It's like someone broke into my studio and photocopied my entire portfolio."

This isn't an isolated incident. It's systematic.

**The Scale of Appropriation**

ChatGPT was trained on hundreds of billions of words—books, articles, blog posts, forum comments—scraped from the internet. DALL-E and Stable Diffusion: billions of images. GitHub Copilot: millions of code repositories.

The companies behind these systems call it "publicly available data." But "publicly available" doesn't mean "free for any use." I can view a painting in a gallery; that doesn't give me the right to reproduce it commercially.

Yet that's exactly what's happening. AI companies are ingesting our words, our images, our code—our creative labour—to build models they then sell access to. The profits are theirs. The exploitation is ours.

**Current Licenses Don't Protect Us**

You might ask: What about Creative Commons? Or copyright law?

Creative Commons licenses (CC BY, CC BY-SA) focus on human use. They require attribution when someone shares or adapts your work. But they don't specifically address AI training—a form of use that didn't exist at scale when these licenses were written.

Copyright law? Reactive. You discover the violation, hire a lawyer, sue, wait years, maybe win. Most creators can't afford that.

Open source licenses (MIT, GPL)? Designed for software. They assume derivatives are traceable (you can see modified code). AI training breaks this: the model is a black box. You can't audit what went in.

**We Need Consent Infrastructure**

The solution isn't to ban AI. AI is transformative—I use ChatGPT for research, DALL-E for brainstorming. The problem isn't the technology. It's the lack of consent.

We need infrastructure that makes permission **legible and enforceable**.

That's why we created the Palimpsest License.

**How It Works**

Palimpsest is a consent-layer licensing framework. Works licensed under it can still be shared freely for human use—reading, remixing, collaboration. But AI training requires explicit creator consent.

Here's the mechanism:

1. **Metadata embeds consent requirements.** When you license a work under Palimpsest, you add machine-readable metadata saying "Consent required for AI training." This uses existing standards (JSON-LD for web, EXIF for images, SPDX for code).

2. **AI companies check metadata.** When scraping the web, they encounter your work and see: "Permission needed."

3. **They request consent via a Consent Registry.** Think OAuth for creative works. They explain what they want to do (train GPT-6), offer terms (£500 + attribution), and wait for your response.

4. **You decide.** Grant consent (accept or negotiate terms), deny (protect artistic integrity), or ignore (work isn't used).

It's structured permission, not prohibition.

**This Isn't DRM**

Critics might say: "This sounds like Digital Rights Management—user-hostile, breaks accessibility."

It's not. DRM uses technical restrictions (encryption, access controls) that prevent files from being opened or used. Palimpsest is a legal framework. Files remain fully accessible. Anyone can read, share, or remix them.

The difference: Palimpsest doesn't restrict what your device can do. It restricts what AI companies can do legally.

Analogy: A "No Trespassing" sign doesn't physically stop you from entering property—but if you ignore it, you're trespassing (legal consequences). Palimpsest is the sign. Enforcement is through copyright law, like GPL or Creative Commons.

**Early Success**

Since launching in June 2025, 10,000 creators have adopted Palimpsest. Platforms like GitHub and DeviantArt are exploring integration. AI companies—the ethical ones—are building consent infrastructure.

One early adopter, a science fiction author, noticed ChatGPT could mimic his writing style. He relicensed his novel under Palimpsest. Weeks later, OpenAI contacted him via the Consent Registry: "We want to train GPT-5 on your book. Will you consent for £200?"

He negotiated: £1,000 + attribution in the model card. OpenAI agreed.

"I made a thousand pounds from a book I'd given away for free online," he told me. "Palimpsest made that possible."

**Regulation Is Coming**

The EU AI Act, which came into force this year, requires AI companies to "identify and comply with reservations of rights expressed by rights holders" (Article 53). Translation: respect licenses.

But how do you do that at scale? You can't manually check billions of works.

**Consent infrastructure—like Palimpsest—provides the answer.**

It's machine-readable. It's auditable. It's enforceable. AI companies using it can demonstrate compliance: "We trained on 1 million works. Here's the consent log. 870,000 creators granted permission. 130,000 denied, so we excluded those works."

Regulators love this. Creators love this. Even ethical AI companies love this (legal clarity beats ambiguity).

**The Future**

By 2030, I believe consent metadata will be as ubiquitous as HTTPS. Works will routinely embed: "License: Palimpsest. Consent required for AI training." Platforms will preserve that metadata. AI companies will respect it.

Not because they're altruistic—because regulation and market forces will demand it.

But we need to build that infrastructure now. We need creators to adopt Palimpsest, platforms to integrate it, AI companies to engage with it, and regulators to endorse it.

**Call to Action**

If you're a creator: License your work under Palimpsest (palimpsest.license). It takes 10 minutes.

If you run a platform: Integrate consent infrastructure. Protect your users. Reduce your legal risk.

If you're an AI developer: Build ethically. Request consent. Document your datasets.

If you're a policymaker: Endorse consent infrastructure. Make compliance achievable.

AI training without consent is theft. We have the tools to fix it.

Let's use them.
