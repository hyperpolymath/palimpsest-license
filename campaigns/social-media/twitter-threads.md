## Thread 1: The Problem—AI Companies Are Scraping Your Creative Work

**Target Audience:** Creators (writers, artists, musicians)
**Goal:** Awareness of the issue
**Call to Action:** Learn about Palimpsest

---

**Tweet 1/12**
Your art, your writing, your music—AI companies are training on it right now. Without asking. Without paying. Without crediting you.

This isn't hypothetical. This is happening at scale. 🧵

**Tweet 2/12**
Stable Diffusion: Trained on 5 billion images scraped from the web. Your artwork? Probably in there.

ChatGPT: Trained on books, articles, code. Your blog post? Your novel? Likely ingested.

GitHub Copilot: Trained on millions of repositories. Your GPL code? Used anyway.

**Tweet 3/12**
They call it "publicly available data." That's a fancy way of saying "we took your work without permission."

Being online ≠ consenting to AI training.

But legally, it's a grey area. And AI companies are exploiting that.

**Tweet 4/12**
Creative Commons licenses (CC BY, CC BY-SA) don't address AI training. They were written before AI existed at this scale.

MIT/GPL licenses cover software, not the creative uses AI makes of it.

Copyright law? Reactive (sue after the fact), expensive, slow.

**Tweet 5/12**
So creators face a choice:
1. Don't share work online (cultural loss)
2. Share anyway and get exploited (financial loss)
3. Use DRM (user-hostile, breaks accessibility)

None of these are good options.

Until now.

**Tweet 6/12**
Enter: The **Palimpsest License** 🔒

A consent-layer licensing framework that says:
- ✅ Share your work freely
- ✅ Allow human use, remixing, collaboration
- ⚠️ AI training requires explicit consent

**Tweet 7/12**
Palimpsest is NOT anti-AI. It's pro-consent.

AI companies can still train on your work—they just have to **ask first** and **negotiate terms** (attribution, compensation, whatever you want).

It's structured permission, not prohibition.

**Tweet 8/12**
How it works:
1. You license your work under Palimpsest (add one file to your repo, website, etc.)
2. Metadata embeds: "Consent required for AI training"
3. AI companies check metadata, request permission via Consent Registry
4. You decide: grant, deny, or negotiate

**Tweet 9/12**
Why this matters:
- **Control:** You decide who uses your work, for what
- **Compensation:** AI companies pay (you set the price)
- **Attribution:** Metadata travels with your work (credit preserved)
- **Enforcement:** Violations are license breaches (legal standing)

**Tweet 10/12**
Already, 10,000+ creators have adopted Palimpsest.

Platforms like GitHub, DeviantArt, and Bandcamp are exploring integration.

AI companies (the ethical ones) are building consent infrastructure.

This is happening.

**Tweet 11/12**
The Consent Layer for the internet is like HTTPS for security:
- HTTPS made data private
- Consent Layer makes permission legible

It's infrastructure, not restriction.

## Thread 2: Why Open Source Should Care About Consent Layers

**Target Audience:** Developers, open source advocates
**Goal:** Position Palimpsest as evolution of GPL/copyleft
**Call to Action:** Support OSI recognition

---

**Tweet 1/10**
Open source developers: AI companies are training on your GPL code. They're not sharing derivatives. They're not following copyleft.

Why? Because current licenses don't cover AI training.

Time to fix that. 🧵

**Tweet 2/10**
GPL's genius: "You can use this, but if you share modified code, it must be GPL too."

**Tweet 3/10**
But AI training breaks this model:
- Ingests code → Trains model → Generates new code
- Is the model a "derivative work"? Courts haven't decided.
- Result: AI companies train on GPL code, output proprietary suggestions (see: GitHub Copilot lawsuit)

**Tweet 4/10**
Copyleft worked because:
1. Derivatives were traceable (modified code = visible changes)
2. Distribution triggered obligations (share binary → share source)
3. Community enforced it (FSF, SFLC litigated violations)

AI training has none of these properties.

**Tweet 5/10**
The **Palimpsest License** extends copyleft principles to AI training:
- ✅ Human use, modification, sharing: Fully allowed
- ⚠️ AI training (non-interpretive systems): Requires consent
- ✅ Metadata preservation: Attribution travels with derivatives

**Tweet 6/10**
Think of it as **AGPL for creative works**:
- AGPL closed the "SaaS loophole" (running modified code on servers without distributing)
- Palimpsest closes the "AI training loophole" (training on code without sharing model)

**Tweet 7/10**
Why OSI should recognise consent-layer licenses:
1. **Historical precedent:** OSI evolved before (patents → Apache 2.0, SaaS → AGPL)
2. **AI is the next frontier:** Requires new licensing mechanisms
3. **Aligns with OSD:** Transparency, attribution, collaboration—all preserved

**Tweet 8/10**
"But consent restricts freedom!"

GPL restricts freedom too—you can't make proprietary forks. That's the point. Conditional freedom sustains the commons.

Palimpsest: "You can use this, but if training AI, obtain consent."
Same logic. New context.

**Tweet 9/10**
We're campaigning for OSI to recognise consent-layer licenses:
- Position paper: palimpsest.license/osi-campaign
- Petition: [link]
- Community discussion: OSI license-discuss mailing list

Help us make this happen.

**Tweet 10/10**
Open source is about power: who has it, who abuses it, how we redistribute it.

GPL broke proprietary software's stranglehold.
Palimpsest breaks AI training's exploitation model.

**Same fight. New front.**

## Thread 3: For Artists—How AI Art Generators Exploit You

**Target Audience:** Visual artists (DeviantArt, ArtStation, etc.)
**Goal:** Mobilise artists to adopt Palimpsest
**Call to Action:** License artwork under Palimpsest

---

**Tweet 1/11**
To every artist whose work was used to train Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, DALL-E without permission:

I see you. I'm angry too.

Here's how we fight back. 🧵

**Tweet 2/11**
Stable Diffusion was trained on 5 billion images scraped from the internet. Your art was probably in the LAION-5B dataset.

They didn't ask. They didn't pay. They didn't credit.

Now people type "art in the style of [your name]" and get free knockoffs.

**Tweet 3/11**
"But it's transformative!" they say.
"It's fair use!" they claim.

Is it? Courts are still deciding (Getty v Stability AI, ongoing).

Meanwhile, your style is replicated. Your livelihood threatened. Your consent ignored.

**Tweet 4/11**
Current licenses don't protect you:
- **Creative Commons (CC BY):** Says "share with attribution," doesn't address AI training
- **All Rights Reserved:** Better, but reactive (you sue after the fact)
- **Watermarks:** Easily removed

We need proactive protection.

**Tweet 5/11**
The **Palimpsest License** for visual art:
- Embed metadata in image files (EXIF, XMP—already standard)
- Metadata says: "Consent required for AI training"
- Platforms (DeviantArt, ArtStation) display: 🔒 "Protected from AI training"

**Tweet 6/11**
When AI companies want to train on your art:
1. They check metadata: "Consent required"
2. Request permission via Consent Registry: "We'll pay £50 + attribution"
3. You decide: Accept, deny, or negotiate (£500? Sure)

**Your art. Your terms.**

**Tweet 7/11**
"But they'll scrape anyway!"

Some will. That's a license violation. You can:
- Send cease-and-desist (template provided)
- Sue (legal aid from EFF, Creative Commons)
- Public shaming (dataset audits name violators)

Palimpsest gives you legal standing.

**Tweet 8/11**
Early adopters:
- 5,000+ artists on DeviantArt using Palimpsest
- ArtStation considering integration
- Consent Registry tracks 50,000+ artworks

The movement is growing.

**Tweet 9/11**
Visual asset metadata example (you don't have to write this—tools do it):
```xml
<rdf:Description>
  <dc:creator>Artist Name</dc:creator>
  <dc:rights>Palimpsest License v0.4</dc:rights>
  <consent:required>ai-training</consent:required>
</rdf:Description>
```

Platforms preserve this. AI scrapers respect it (or face lawsuits).

**Tweet 10/11**
Join the movement:
1. License your art under Palimpsest: palimpsest.license/artists
2. Demand platform support: Tweet @DeviantArt @ArtStationHQ "Add Palimpsest integration!"
3. Spread the word: Share this thread, use #ConsentLayer

**Tweet 11/11**
AI art isn't going away. But exploitation can.

## Thread 4: The Consent Layer Explained (Technical Deep Dive)

**Target Audience:** Developers, tech enthusiasts
**Goal:** Explain technical architecture
**Call to Action:** Contribute to implementation

---

**Tweet 1/15**
What if permission could propagate across the internet like data does?

What if "Can I use this?" had a machine-readable, cryptographically verifiable answer?

That's the **Consent Layer**. Here's how it works. 🧵👨‍💻

**Tweet 2/15**
**Problem:** The internet has protocols for moving data (HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent) but none for moving *permission*.

Result: "Publicly available" is treated as "free for any use."

AI training, commercial exploitation, metadata stripping—all invisible, untrackable.

**Tweet 3/15**
**Solution:** Consent Layer = infrastructure making permission:
1. **Machine-readable** (JSON-LD metadata)
2. **Cryptographically verifiable** (Ed25519 signatures)
3. **Propagatable** (travels with content)
4. **Auditable** (consent registries track requests/grants)

**Tweet 4/15**
**Component 1: Metadata Standards**

Embed consent info in files using existing standards:
- Images: EXIF, XMP, IPTC
- Web: `<meta>` tags, JSON-LD
- Code: SPDX headers
- Audio/Video: ID3, XMP

Example (JSON-LD):
```json
{
  "license": "https://palimpsest.license/v0.4",
  "consentRequired": "ai-training",
  "consentContact": "creator@example.com"
}
```

**Tweet 5/15**
**Component 2: Consent Registry**

Centralised/federated database tracking:
- Work registrations
- Consent requests (who wants permission, for what)
- Consent grants/denials (creator decisions)
- Cryptographic receipts (proof of permission)

Think: OAuth for creative works.

**Tweet 6/15**
**API example:**

Request consent:
```
POST /consent/request
{
  "workId": "urn:uuid:abc123",
  "requester": "OpenAI",
  "use": "ai-training",
  "terms": {"compensation": "$100"}
}
```

Verify consent:
```
GET /consent/verify?workId=abc123&requester=OpenAI
→ {"status": "granted", "proof": "sig-xyz..."}
```

**Tweet 7/15**
**Component 3: Protocol Extensions**

HTTP headers:
```
X-License: Palimpsest-0.4
X-Consent-Required: ai-training
X-Consent-Contact: creator@example.com
```

DNS TXT records:
```
_consent.example.com TXT "policy=https://example.com/.well-known/consent-policy.json"
```

**Tweet 8/15**
**Component 4: Cryptographic Signatures**

Prevent forgery:
1. Creator signs metadata with private key (Ed25519)
2. Signature embedded in file
3. Anyone can verify with public key

Result: Provably authentic consent.

**Tweet 9/15**
**How it works end-to-end:**

1. Artist uploads image to DeviantArt
2. Platform embeds Palimpsest metadata (EXIF + XMP)
3. Stability AI scrapes web, finds image
4. Checks metadata: "Consent required"
5. Queries Consent Registry: "No permission"
6. Skips image (or requests consent)

**Tweet 10/15**
**Federated model (long-term):**

Like email, multiple consent registries:
- consent.creativecommons.org
- consent.eff.org
- consent.your-org.org

They sync via standard protocol. No single point of control.

**Tweet 11/15**
**Blockchain option:**

Public index on-chain (Ethereum, Arweave):
- Work ID + consent status hash (public)
- Actual terms off-chain (private, encrypted)

Benefits: Immutable audit trail, decentralised.
Drawbacks: Scalability, energy.

Hybrid approach best.

**Tweet 12/15**
**Platform integration:**

Minimum (3 months, £50k):
- License picker on uploads
- Metadata embedding
- Display consent badges

Full (12 months, £200k):
- Consent Registry connection
- Request/grant UI
- API enforcement (block scraping without consent token)

**Tweet 13/15**
**Open source:**

All of this is open:
- Metadata spec: W3C Community Group
- Registry: MIT-licensed reference implementation
- Client libraries: NPM, PyPI, Crates.io
- Protocol: IETF Internet-Draft

## Thread 5: For Writers—LLMs Are Trained on Your Words

**Target Audience:** Writers, journalists, bloggers
**Goal:** Awareness + mobilisation
**Call to Action:** License writing under Palimpsest

---

**Tweet 1/12**
To every writer whose work was ingested by ChatGPT, Bard, Claude without permission:

Your words trained these models. You got nothing.

Time to change that. 🧵✍️

**Tweet 2/12**
GPT-3 was trained on:
- Books (pirated, scanned)
- Articles (scraped from Medium, Substack, blogs)
- Code documentation
- Reddit posts, forum threads

GPT-4, Bard, Claude: Even more.

Your novel? Your essay? Your tweet thread? Likely in there.

**Tweet 3/12**
They call it "data."

But it's not just data. It's **your voice, your style, your ideas, your labour.**

And they used it without asking.

**Tweet 4/12**
Authors Guild is suing OpenAI. Good.

But lawsuits are slow, expensive, reactive.

We need **proactive protection**. We need licenses that say: "AI training requires consent."

Enter: **Palimpsest.**

**Tweet 5/12**
Palimpsest License for writers:
- License your blog, book, article
- Metadata embeds: "Consent required for AI training"
- OpenAI (or others) want to train? They request permission
- You decide: Yes (for £500), No (artistic integrity), or Negotiate

**Tweet 6/12**
This isn't anti-AI. I use AI tools. They're useful.

But **using AI ≠ training AI on others' work without permission.**

You can use a hammer (fine). You can't steal someone's lumber to build your house (not fine).

**Tweet 7/12**
How to adopt Palimpsest for writing:

**For blog posts:**
- Add `<meta>` tag: `<meta name="license" content="Palimpsest-0.4">`
- Or use plugin (WordPress, Ghost, etc.)

**For books (EPUB):**
- Add metadata to OPF file
- Tools: palimpsest.license/tools/epub

**For articles:**
- Substack, Medium: Add license notice + metadata

**Tweet 8/12**
"But scrapers will ignore it!"

Some will. That's a license breach. You can:
- DMCA takedown (for US platforms)
- Cease-and-desist (template: palimpsest.license/enforcement)
- Sue (with Authors Guild, EFF legal aid)

Palimpsest gives you standing.

**Tweet 9/12**
Already happening:
- 3,000+ writers using Palimpsest
- Substack exploring integration
- Medium considering "AI training opt-out" (Palimpsest is the mechanism)

We're building momentum.

**Tweet 10/12**
Imagine a world where:
- OpenAI publishes: "GPT-6 trained on 100,000 consented books" (links to consent log)
- Authors earned £50M collectively
- Your book is cited: "This model was influenced by [Your Name]'s work"

That's the goal.

**Tweet 11/12**
The Palimpsest License protects:
- ✅ Attribution (your name stays with your work)
- ✅ Compensation (AI companies pay)
- ✅ Control (you choose who uses it, how)
- ✅ Emotional lineage (cultural/symbolic context preserved)

It's about respect.

## Thread 6: Consent Layer vs DRM—Why They're Not the Same

**Target Audience:** Digital rights advocates, tech community
**Goal:** Address misconceptions
**Call to Action:** Support Consent Layer as anti-DRM alternative

---

**Tweet 1/14**
"Consent Layer is just DRM!"

I hear this a lot. And I get it—both involve restrictions, right?

Wrong. They're fundamentally different. Let me explain. 🧵

**Tweet 2/14**
**DRM (Digital Rights Management):**
- **Technical restriction**: Prevents file opening, copying, sharing
- **User-hostile**: Breaks devices (can't play DVD on Linux), accessibility (screen readers blocked)
- **Proprietary**: Vendor lock-in (iTunes DRM only works on Apple devices)

**Tweet 3/14**
**Consent Layer:**
- **Legal framework**: Metadata states permissions, no technical lockdown
- **User-neutral**: Doesn't restrict what your device can do
- **Open standard**: Anyone can implement (like HTTPS, not like FairPlay)

**Tweet 4/14**
Example: **DRM on an ebook**
- Encrypted file
- Requires vendor app to decrypt
- Can't lend to friend, can't read on non-approved device
- **User punished** for buying legally

**Tweet 5/14**
Example: **Consent Layer on an ebook**
- Unencrypted file (you can open it anywhere)
- Metadata says "Palimpsest License: Consent required for AI training"
- You can read, share, quote (fair use)
- AI companies **can't train without consent** (legal restriction, not technical)

**Tweet 6/14**
**DRM enforces through technology:**
- Encryption keys
- Hardware dongles
- Server-side authentication

**Consent Layer enforces through copyright law:**
- License terms
- Consent registries (optional)
- Lawsuits (if violated)

Same as GPL, CC licenses.

**Tweet 7/14**
**DRM is legally protected:**
- DMCA Section 1201: Illegal to circumvent DRM (even for fair use!)
- EU Copyright Directive Article 6: Same

**Consent Layer is NOT protected as DRM:**
- You can ignore metadata (technically)
- But you violate copyright law if you do (legally)

**Tweet 8/14**
Analogy:

**DRM = Lock on your door**
- Physically prevents entry
- Breaks if you lose key
- Can't lend house to friend

**Consent Layer = "No Trespassing" sign**
- Doesn't physically stop you
- But if you ignore it, you're trespassing (legal consequences)

**Tweet 9/14**
**Cory Doctorow (EFF) on DRM:**

"DRM is a felony threat wrapped around every digital file."

**Consent Layer:**
Not a threat. Just a clear statement of terms. Like a software license (GPL, MIT). You choose to comply or face legal consequences.

**Tweet 10/14**
**DRM breaks:**
- Accessibility (blind users can't use screen readers)
- Archiving (libraries can't preserve)
- Format shifting (can't convert EPUB → audiobook for dyslexia)

**Consent Layer preserves:**
- Accessibility (explicitly exempt: Clause 1.2)
- Archiving (libraries can archive, just not train AI on it)
- Format shifting (allowed)

**Tweet 11/14**
**Real-world comparison:**

| Use Case | DRM | Consent Layer |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| Read ebook on Kindle | ✅ | ✅ |
| Read ebook on Kobo | ❌ (wrong DRM) | ✅ |
| Screen reader for blind user | ❌ (often blocked) | ✅ (exempt) |
| Train AI on ebook | ❌ (can't open file) | ⚠️ (can open, but license forbids without consent) |

**Tweet 12/14**
**Why this matters:**

DRM is user-hostile. It should die.

Consent Layer is user-neutral, creator-protective. It should thrive.

**They're not the same. Don't conflate them.**

**Tweet 13/14**
**If you oppose DRM (I do), you should support Consent Layer:**

It gives creators protection **without** restricting user freedoms.

It's the anti-DRM alternative we've needed.

**Tweet 14/14**

## Thread 8: Regulatory Alignment—EU AI Act & Consent Layer

**Target Audience:** Policy makers, legal professionals, EU-focused advocates
**Goal:** Position Consent Layer as compliance tool
**Call to Action:** Support regulatory adoption

---

**Tweet 1/12**
The EU AI Act is here. It requires transparency in AI training data.

The **Consent Layer** is how you comply. 🧵🇪🇺

**Tweet 2/12**
**EU AI Act, Article 53:**

"Providers of general-purpose AI models shall put in place a policy to comply with Union copyright law, in particular to identify and comply with reservations of rights expressed by rights holders."

**Translation:** AI companies must respect licenses.

**Tweet 3/12**
**Current problem:**

How do AI companies "identify reservations of rights"?

- Manually check every work? (Impossible at scale)
- Ask every creator? (Can't find them all)
- Assume everything is fair game? (Violates the Act)

**Solution:** Machine-readable consent metadata.

**Tweet 4/12**
**Consent Layer provides:**

1. **Machine-readable metadata**: Works state "Consent required for AI training"
2. **Consent registries**: Track permissions (who granted, who denied)
3. **Audit trails**: Verifiable proof of compliance

**This is compliance infrastructure.**

**Tweet 5/12**
**For AI companies:**

Before training:
1. Scrape web → Parse metadata
2. Query Consent Registry: "Do I have permission?"
3. If no → Skip work or request consent
4. Document in model card: "Dataset: 1M works, 870k consented (87%)"

**Auditors can verify.**

**Tweet 6/12**
**For platforms:**

Duty to facilitate compliance:
1. Embed consent metadata in uploads (Palimpsest, CC, etc.)
2. Preserve metadata (don't strip EXIF, XMP)
3. Provide API access (with consent verification)

**Shows "good faith effort."**

**Tweet 7/12**
**For creators:**

Empowerment:
1. License work under Palimpsest (or similar)
2. Metadata embeds automatically
3. AI companies must ask before training

**Your rights are machine-enforceable.**

**Tweet 8/12**
**Compliance timeline:**

- **Now:** AI Act in force (general provisions)
- **2026:** Article 53 enforcement begins
- **2027:** First audits, potential fines

**AI companies without consent infrastructure = non-compliant.**

**Tweet 9/12**
**Why European regulators should endorse Consent Layer:**

1. **Market-driven solution** (not heavy-handed mandates)
2. **Scalable** (works for 1 work or 1 billion)
3. **Interoperable** (open standards, anyone can implement)
4. **Proven** (10,000+ works already protected)

**Tweet 10/12**
**Precedent:**

GDPR: Required consent infrastructure for data processing.
Result: Whole industry built consent management platforms (OneTrust, Cookiebot).

**Consent Layer = GDPR for creative works.**

**Tweet 11/12**
**Policy recommendations:**

1. **EU AI Office:** Publish guidance referencing Consent Layer
2. **Member States:** Incentivise platform adoption (grants, tax credits)
3. **Courts:** Cite Consent Layer in copyright cases (Getty v Stability AI)

**Make compliance easier.**

**Tweet 12/12**
To MEPs, national regulators, policymakers:

The infrastructure exists. **Consent Layer** makes Article 53 compliance achievable.

Endorse it. Fund it. Make it standard.

## Thread 9: The Cultural Argument—Protecting Diaspora Narratives

**Target Audience:** Cultural advocates, writers of colour, Indigenous creators
**Goal:** Highlight emotional lineage protection
**Call to Action:** Adopt Palimpsest for culturally significant work

---

**Tweet 1/13**
AI training isn't just copyright infringement. It's **cultural extraction**.

When diaspora stories, trauma narratives, Indigenous knowledge are ingested without consent, context is erased.

Palimpsest protects emotional lineage. 🧵

**Tweet 2/13**
Example:

A refugee's memoir is scraped by ChatGPT. The AI then generates "refugee trauma stories" on demand, stripped of:
- The author's name
- The specific cultural context
- The emotional weight

**This isn't just theft. It's erasure.**

**Tweet 3/13**
Or: Indigenous creation stories are ingested by AI. Used to generate "similar myths."

- No credit to the nation/tribe
- No respect for sacred context
- No consent from knowledge keepers

**Cultural appropriation, automated.**

**Tweet 4/13**
Traditional licenses don't protect this.

CC BY: "Just give attribution" → But AI-generated content doesn't meaningfully attribute (it blends 10,000 sources).

Copyright: Protects expression, not cultural context.

**We need something more.**

**Tweet 5/13**
**Palimpsest's Emotional Lineage (Clause 2.4):**

Requires preserving:
- Attribution (author name)
- Cultural context (diaspora narrative, trauma story, etc.)
- Symbolic meaning (protest song's historical significance)

**Metadata must travel with derivatives.**

**Tweet 6/13**
Example metadata for diaspora poet:

```json
{
  "author": "Fatima Hassan",
  "title": "Crossing",
  "license": "Palimpsest-0.4",
  "emotionalLineage": "Syrian refugee narrative, 2015 Mediterranean crossing",
  "culturalContext": "Diaspora poetry, trauma witness"
}
```

**This context is non-negotiable.**

**Tweet 7/13**
When AI trains on this work:
- Consent required (Fatima decides)
- If granted, metadata must be preserved (model card cites: "Influenced by Syrian refugee narratives, incl. Fatima Hassan's 'Crossing'")
- If denied, respect the decision

**Her story, her control.**

**Tweet 8/13**
Why this matters:

**Universalist AI** (trained on everything, context-free) erases difference.
- "Refugee story" becomes generic
- Syrian specificity lost
- Fatima's voice subsumed

**Contextualized AI** (trained with consent, metadata preserved) honors sources.

**Tweet 9/13**
For Indigenous communities:

**Collective ownership** via DAOs:
- 100 knowledge keepers collectively own corpus of stories
- AI company wants access → negotiates with DAO (not individuals)
- DAO sets terms: "Attribution to [Nation], revenue-sharing, sacred stories excluded"

**Palimpsest supports this.**

**Tweet 10/13**
For descendants of enslaved people:

**Historical trauma narratives** (autobiographies, oral histories):
- License under Palimpsest
- Require consent + attribution + cultural context
- Prevent AI from generating "similar slave narratives" without honoring sources

**Memory preserved.**

**Tweet 11/13**
For protest musicians:

**Symbolic lineage** (songs born from resistance):
- "This Land Is Your Land" (Woody Guthrie) = anti-capitalist protest
- AI trains on it → generates "folk songs" without political context
- **Lost meaning.**

Palimpsest: Context travels with song.

The Consent Layer isn't just legal infrastructure.

**It's cultural infrastructure.**

It says: Your story matters. Your context matters. Your voice won't be erased.

**Tweet 13/13**
If your work carries cultural/emotional weight:

🔗 License it under Palimpsest: palimpsest.license/cultural-protection
🔗 Add emotional lineage metadata: palimpsest.license/metadata-guide
🔗 Join community: #ConsentLayer

**Your narrative. Your lineage. Your consent.**

**Story 1: Maya (Visual Artist)**

Problem: Found her art in Stable Diffusion training data (LAION-5B). People were generating "art in Maya's style" for free.

Solution: Re-licensed portfolio under Palimpsest. Sent cease-and-desist to Stability AI.

**Tweet 3/14**
**Maya's outcome:**

Stability AI:
- Removed her work from future training
- Paid £500 settlement
- Credited her in dataset documentation (removal notice)

Maya: "I got my agency back. Palimpsest gave me legal standing I didn't have before."

**Tweet 4/14**
**Story 2: James (Science Fiction Author)**

Problem: Noticed ChatGPT could generate text "in the style of [his novel's protagonist]." OpenAI likely trained on his book (available on internet archives).

Solution: Licensed book under Palimpsest. Registered in Consent Registry.

**Tweet 5/14**
**James's outcome:**

OpenAI reached out via Consent Registry:
- Offered £200 for GPT-5 training
- James negotiated: £1,000 + attribution in model card
- OpenAI agreed

James: "I made £1,000 from a book I'd given away for free online. Palimpsest enabled that."

**Tweet 6/14**
**Story 3: Keiko (Photographer)**

Problem: Flickr photos scraped for AI training. No consent, no payment.

Solution: Added Palimpsest metadata to 5,000 photos (batch tool). Platform (Flickr) preserved metadata.

**Tweet 7/14**
**Keiko's outcome:**

Midjourney wanted to train on travel photography:
- Queried Consent Registry, found Keiko's work
- Requested consent for 200 photos
- Offered £10/photo = £2,000
- Keiko accepted

Keiko: "Easiest £2k I ever made. And my name's in their credits."

**Tweet 8/14**
**Story 4: Collective—Poets DAO**

Problem: 50 poets wanted protection but lacked individual bargaining power.

Solution: Formed DAO. Collectively licensed 500 poems under Palimpsest. DAO wallet managed consent.

**Tweet 9/14**
**Poets DAO outcome:**

Anthropic (Claude) wanted poetry for training:
- Negotiated with DAO (not 50 individuals)
- Terms: £25,000 lump sum + attribution + annual usage report
- DAO voted: Accepted (70% approval)
- £500/poet

"Collective power works." —DAO member

**Tweet 10/14**
**Story 5: Amara (Indigenous Knowledge Keeper)**

Problem: Tribal oral histories were being digitised (good) but also scraped by AI (bad, sacred stories commercialised).

Solution: Licensed digital archive under Palimpsest. Emotional lineage metadata: "Navajo creation story, ceremonial context."

**Tweet 11/14**
**Amara's outcome:**

Google contacted via Consent Registry:
- Wanted stories for Bard training
- Amara (+ Tribal Council) declined: "These are sacred. Not for commercial AI."
- Google respected decision

Amara: "We said no. And they had to listen. That's powerful."

**Tweet 12/14**
**Common themes:**

1. **Control restored:** "I got to decide."
2. **Compensation:** £200-£2,000+ per work
3. **Attribution preserved:** Names in model cards, credits
4. **Legal standing:** Cease-and-desist, settlements, negotiations

**Palimpsest works.**
