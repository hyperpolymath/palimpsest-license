## SCRIPT 1: EXPLAINER VIDEO (5 Minutes)

**Title:** "The Palimpsest License Explained: Your Work, Your Consent, Your Rights"

**Target Audience:** General creators (writers, artists, musicians, coders)
**Format:** Animated explainer video with voiceover
**Tone:** Friendly, accessible, empowering
**Length:** 5:00 minutes (750 words at 150 wpm)

---

### Visual Script

**Scene 1: The Problem (0:00-1:00)**

*Visual: Animation of AI scraper hoovering up artworks, articles, music from the internet*

**Voiceover:**
"You create. You share. You contribute to the internet.

But here's what's happening behind the scenes: AI systems—ChatGPT, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion—are training on your work.

They scrape billions of images, articles, songs, and code from the internet. Your creations are in there.

And here's the thing: They didn't ask. They didn't pay. They didn't credit you.

They call it 'publicly available data.' But you never consented to AI training."

*Visual: Chart showing billions of works ingested, £0 to creators*

---

**Scene 2: Why Current Licenses Don't Help (1:00-1:45)**

*Visual: Creative Commons, MIT, GPL logos with question marks*

**Voiceover:**
"You might be thinking: What about Creative Commons? Or copyright law?

Here's the problem: Those licenses were written before AI training existed at this scale. They address human use—sharing, remixing, attribution.

They don't distinguish between 'reading your article' and 'training an AI on it to generate similar content.'

AI companies are exploiting that gap. And creators have no recourse."

*Visual: Gap illustration—licenses on one side, AI training on the other, no bridge*

---

**Scene 3: Introducing Palimpsest (1:45-2:30)**

*Visual: Palimpsest logo appears, consent layer graphic*

**Voiceover:**
"Enter the Palimpsest License.

It's a new licensing framework that says: Your work can still be shared freely for human use. But AI training requires your explicit consent.

It's not anti-AI. It's pro-consent.

Think of it as adding a consent layer to the internet—like HTTPS for permission."

*Visual: Work with embedded consent metadata, AI scraper sees "Permission Required"*

---

**Scene 4: How It Works (2:30-3:30)**

*Visual: Step-by-step animation*

**Voiceover:**
"Here's how Palimpsest works:

Step 1: You license your work under Palimpsest. Add one file to your website or repository.

Step 2: Metadata embeds: 'Consent required for AI training.' This is machine-readable—AI scrapers can detect it automatically.

Step 3: When an AI company wants to train on your work, they check the metadata. It says: 'Permission needed.'

Step 4: They request consent via a Consent Registry. They explain what they want to do—train GPT-6, for example—and offer terms. Maybe £100. Maybe attribution in their model card.

Step 5: You decide. Grant consent (accept their offer or negotiate), deny (protect your artistic integrity), or ignore (your work isn't used).

You're in control."

*Visual: Creator dashboard showing consent request, options to grant/deny/negotiate*

---

**Scene 5: Real Results (3:30-4:00)**

*Visual: Testimonial quotes from Maya, James, Keiko*

**Voiceover:**
"Early adopters are already seeing results.

Maya, a digital artist: 'I sent a cease-and-desist to Stability AI. They removed my work from future training and paid £500.'

James, a science fiction author: 'OpenAI requested consent. I negotiated £1,000 plus attribution. Easiest money I ever made.'

Keiko, a photographer: 'Midjourney wanted 200 of my photos. I charged £10 each. That's £2,000.'

This is happening. Right now."

*Visual: Counter showing 10,000+ creators adopted*

---

**Scene 6: This Isn't DRM (4:00-4:30)**

*Visual: DRM (locked file) vs. Palimpsest (open file with metadata)*

**Voiceover:**
"You might be wondering: Isn't this like DRM?

No. DRM locks files down—you can't open them without special software. User-hostile.

Palimpsest doesn't restrict your device. It's a legal framework. Your files stay open. Anyone can read, share, or remix them.

It's AI training that requires consent.

Think of it as a 'No Trespassing' sign—not a locked gate."

---

**Scene 7: Join the Movement (4:30-5:00)**

*Visual: Growing network of creators, platforms, AI companies*

**Voiceover:**
"Ten thousand creators have adopted Palimpsest. Platforms like GitHub and DeviantArt are exploring integration. AI companies—the ethical ones—are building consent infrastructure.

This is the future: An internet where creators are protected, not exploited. Where AI is built ethically, with permission.

## SCRIPT 2: LIGHTNING TALK (5 Minutes)

**Title:** "Consent-Layer Licensing: Protecting Creators in the AI Era"

**Venue:** Tech conferences (FOSDEM, PyCon, DEF CON), creative conferences (SXSW, Adobe MAX)
**Format:** Live presentation, slides
**Tone:** Energetic, punchy, memorable
**Length:** 5:00 minutes (650 words spoken)

---

### Slide Deck

**Slide 1: Title**
- Title: "Consent-Layer Licensing: Protecting Creators in the AI Era"
- Subtitle: "The Palimpsest License Explained"
- Speaker: [Your Name], Palimpsest Stewardship Council
- URL: palimpsest.license

---

**Slide 2: The Problem (0:00-0:45)**

*Slide visual: AI scraper graphic, statistics*

**Speaker:**
"Quick question: Have you ever published anything online? Code, writing, art?

Congrats—you've probably trained an AI.

ChatGPT: Trained on hundreds of billions of words scraped from the internet. Your blog post? Likely in there.

Stable Diffusion: 5 billion images. Your artwork? Probably.

GitHub Copilot: Millions of repositories. Your GPL code? Yep, even if GPL says derivatives should be shared.

They didn't ask. They didn't pay. And here's the kicker: It's legally ambiguous. They call it 'fair use' or 'publicly available data.' Courts are still deciding."

---

**Slide 3: Why This Matters (0:45-1:15)**

*Slide visual: Creator with £0 earned, AI company with £billions*

**Speaker:**
"This isn't just about money—though let's be real, OpenAI is worth billions, and creators got nothing.

It's about control. Your art, your words, your code—used to train systems that replicate your style, without your consent.

It's about attribution. AI-generated content doesn't meaningfully credit sources. Your voice gets blended with 10,000 others and erased.

It's about power. Trillion-dollar companies vs. individual creators. That's not a fair fight."

---

**Slide 4: The Solution: Consent Layer (1:15-2:00)**

*Slide visual: Palimpsest logo, consent layer diagram*

**Speaker:**
"The Palimpsest License introduces a consent layer.

Your work can still be shared freely—humans can read, remix, collaborate. But AI training requires explicit consent.

How it works:
1. License your work under Palimpsest (add one file)
2. Metadata embeds: 'Consent required for AI training'
3. AI companies check metadata, request permission via Consent Registry
4. You decide: grant (maybe for £500), deny, or negotiate

It's structured permission, not prohibition."

---

**Slide 5: Not DRM (2:00-2:30)**

*Slide visual: DRM vs. Palimpsest comparison table*

**Speaker:**
"I know what you're thinking: 'This sounds like DRM.'

Nope.

DRM: Technical restriction. Locks files. Breaks accessibility.
Palimpsest: Legal framework. Files stay open. Just requires consent for specific uses.

DRM: Illegal to circumvent (DMCA).
Palimpsest: Enforced through copyright law, like GPL.

DRM: User-hostile.
Palimpsest: User-neutral, creator-protective."

---

**Slide 6: Early Results (2:30-3:00)**

*Slide visual: Testimonial quotes*

**Speaker:**
"Real creators, real results.

Maya: Visual artist, found her work in Stable Diffusion training data. Adopted Palimpsest, sent cease-and-desist, got £500 settlement.

James: Author, noticed ChatGPT mimicking his style. OpenAI requested consent, negotiated £1,000.

Keiko: Photographer, Midjourney wanted her images, she charged £2,000 total.

Ten thousand creators have adopted Palimpsest in five months. Platforms like GitHub are exploring integration."

---

**Slide 7: Standards & Adoption (3:00-3:30)**

*Slide visual: W3C, IETF, OSI logos*

**Speaker:**
"This isn't just a grassroots movement. We're building infrastructure.

W3C Community Group: Developing consent metadata standards.
IETF: Internet-Draft for HTTP extensions.
SPDX: Palimpsest identifier integration.
OSI: Campaigning for consent-layer license recognition.

EU AI Act (Article 53): Requires training data transparency. Palimpsest provides compliance infrastructure."

---

**Slide 8: The Vision (3:30-4:00)**

*Slide visual: Timeline to 2030*

**Speaker:**
"By 2030, consent metadata will be as ubiquitous as HTTPS.

You won't publish a work without embedding: 'License: Palimpsest. Consent required.'

Platforms will preserve that metadata.

AI companies will respect it—because regulation and market forces demand it.

Creators will be compensated. Attributed. In control.

That's the future we're building."

---

**Slide 9: Call to Action (4:00-4:30)**

*Slide visual: Three paths (Creator, Platform, Developer)*

**Speaker:**
"How you can help:

Creators: License your work. palimpsest.license/adopt

Platforms: Integrate consent infrastructure. It's good business—legal protection, user retention, competitive advantage. We have technical specs and ROI calculators.

Developers: Contribute to open-source implementations. github.com/consent-layer

AI companies: Build ethically. Request consent. It's better for everyone."

---

**Slide 10: Closing (4:30-5:00)**

*Slide visual: Logo, QR code to website*

**Speaker:**
"The internet was built on sharing. But sharing without consent isn't collaboration—it's exploitation.

Palimpsest makes consent infrastructure. HTTPS for permission.

Visit palimpsest.license. Read the docs. Adopt the license. Join the movement.

Your work. Your consent. Your rights.

Questions? Find me after or email hello@palimpsest.license.

Thank you."

*Hold slide for applause*

**Panelists:** Creator advocate, AI company rep, platform lead, legal expert, policy maker
**Tone:** Balanced, respectful debate, constructive

---

### Palimpsest Representative Talking Points

**Opening Statement (2 minutes)**

"I represent the Palimpsest License, a consent-layer framework. Our position is simple: AI training on creative works should require consent. Not because we're anti-AI—we're pro-consent. Creators deserve control, compensation, and credit. Palimpsest provides infrastructure to make that happen. It's good for creators, good for platforms, and ultimately good for ethical AI companies who want defensible datasets."

---

### Key Messages (Weave Into Discussion)

**On Fair Use:**
"Fair use was designed for contexts where permission was impractical—quoting a book in a review, parodying a song. But AI training isn't that. It's systematic, large-scale, and lucrative. If music sampling requires licenses (post-1990s court cases), why doesn't AI training?"

**On Innovation:**
"Consent doesn't kill innovation. Music sampling didn't kill hip-hop—it created a licensing market. Film adaptations of books didn't stop because authors require permission—it created a thriving industry. AI will adapt. Ethical constraints drive better innovation."

**On Technical Feasibility:**
"Critics say 'You can't enforce metadata.' But we enforce GPL, Creative Commons, copyright generally. Yes, some violate—that's why we have courts. Palimpsest uses existing copyright law, plus emerging detection methods: watermarking, memorisation analysis, dataset audits."

**On Platform Adoption:**
"Platforms win with consent infrastructure. Legal risk reduction (avoid lawsuits), user retention (creators stay where they're protected), competitive advantage ('We protect creators' is powerful marketing). ROI is 4.5x-495x in Year 1. It's good business."

**On AI Company Perspective:**
"Ethical AI companies—Anthropic, Hugging Face—are exploring consent infrastructure. Why? Legal defensibility ('We trained on consented data'), market differentiation ('We're ethical'), regulatory compliance (EU AI Act Article 53). It's the smart move."

**On Regulation:**
"The EU AI Act requires AI companies to 'identify and comply with reservations of rights.' That's exactly what Palimpsest does—machine-readable reservations. Regulators shouldn't mandate specific licenses, but they should endorse consent infrastructure as best practice."

**On Global Scope:**
"Palimpsest is global. Primary jurisdiction is the Netherlands (where we're based), but it works worldwide via the Berne Convention. Copyright is universal; consent-layer licensing piggybacks on that."

**On Future Vision:**
"By 2030, consent metadata is ubiquitous. Works routinely embed 'Consent required.' Platforms preserve it. AI companies respect it. Creators earn cumulative billions. AI remains innovative—just built on ethical foundations. That's the world we're building."

---

### Responses to Likely Objections

**Objection: "This fragments the internet."**

**Response:**
"Fragmentation already exists—CC BY, CC BY-SA, GPL, MIT, proprietary. Palimpsest adds one more option. That's diversity, not fragmentation. Creators choose the license that fits their needs. More choice = more freedom."

**Objection: "Consent is too burdensome for AI companies."**

**Response:**
"Is it more burdensome than billion-dollar lawsuits? Consent infrastructure is scalable—query a registry API, get yes/no. We're building that infrastructure. It's no harder than OAuth or HTTPS—both seemed burdensome initially, now they're standard."

**Objection: "Small creators won't benefit."**

**Response:**
"Collective models help. DAOs, unions, guilds negotiate on behalf of small creators. One poet earning £50 individually might not seem significant, but 1,000 poets via a DAO earning £50,000 collectively? That's power."

**Objection: "This is just moral panic about AI."**

**Response:**
"Not panic—pragmatism. AI companies are already facing lawsuits (Getty, Authors Guild). Regulation is coming (EU AI Act). Market dynamics are shifting (ethical AI = premium). Palimpsest provides a solution before the crisis deepens."

---

### Engaging with Other Panelists

**To AI Company Rep:**
"You mentioned training on 'publicly available data.' But public ≠ permission. If I can see a painting in a gallery, does that mean I can commercially reproduce it? No. Same principle. Publicly available works still have licenses. Palimpsest just makes those licenses machine-readable for AI contexts."

**To Platform Lead:**
"Your users want protection. We know this from surveys—62% would switch platforms for AI safeguards. Integrating consent infrastructure isn't charity; it's competitive strategy. GitHub integrated 'Issues' and 'Pull Requests,' became industry standard. Consent Layer could be your next defining feature."

**To Legal Expert:**
"From your perspective, what's the strongest legal argument for consent-layer licensing? [Listen, then build on their points.] I'd add: Consent layers extend existing copyright principles. We're not inventing new law—we're applying old law to new contexts."

**To Policy Maker:**
"You've talked about regulation. How can voluntary frameworks like Palimpsest complement regulation? [Listen, then:] I'd argue consent infrastructure makes compliance cheaper and more efficient than top-down mandates. Regulators set standards; industry builds tools. That's the sweet spot."

---

### Closing Statement (2 minutes)

"To summarise our position: AI is transformative. We're not opposing it. But transformation shouldn't mean exploitation.

Consent-layer licensing—exemplified by Palimpsest—gives creators control, platforms legal clarity, and AI companies a pathway to ethical development.

We've seen early success: 10,000 creators, platform interest, regulatory alignment.

The infrastructure exists. Standards are being developed. The question isn't 'Can we do this?' It's 'Will we do this?'

I believe the answer is yes. Because the alternative—unregulated AI training, creator exploitation, legal chaos—is unsustainable.

Let's build the Consent Layer for the internet. Together."

---

### Q&A Preparation

**Anticipated Questions:**

**Q: "How do you verify consent? Can't AI companies lie?"**
A: "Consent receipts are cryptographically signed. Registries maintain audit logs. Third-party auditors can verify. Similar to how financial audits work—trust but verify."

**Q: "What about works already in training datasets (retroactive use)?"**
A: "Palimpsest protects going forward. For retroactive use, creators can request disclosure ('Was my work used?'), negotiate compensation, or sue. Some AI companies (Stability AI) have offered opt-out mechanisms for future versions."

**Q: "Does this apply to AI-generated content too?"**
A: "Different question. Palimpsest addresses *training inputs* (your work used to train AI). AI-generated *outputs* are a separate legal question (who owns them?). Both important, but Palimpsest focuses on inputs."

**Q: "How does this work with open-source software?"**
A: "Complementary. Use GPL for code (copyleft for software), Palimpsest for documentation/creative assets. Dual licensing is common (e.g., Linux kernel is GPL, but logos/trademarks have separate licenses)."

**Q: "Will this slow down AI research?"**
A: "Academic research often gets exempted (fair use for non-commercial research). But even so, many creators grant consent for research—especially if it's truly non-commercial and properly attributed. The issue is commercial AI companies using 'research' as cover for product development."
