## SECTION 1: CALL FOR PAPERS (CFP)

### International Conference on Creative Works Licensing in the AI Era

**Co-organized by:** Palimpsest Stewardship Council, [University Partner TBD], Creative Commons

**Date:** June 2026 (proposed)
**Location:** Amsterdam, Netherlands + Virtual Hybrid
**Submission Deadline:** 15 February 2026

### Conference Theme

The rapid advancement of AI systems has created unprecedented challenges for creative works licensing. Traditional frameworks (copyright law, Creative Commons, open source licenses) were not designed for automated pattern extraction at scale. This conference explores legal, technical, ethical, and social dimensions of licensing in the AI era.

We invite submissions addressing:
- **Legal frameworks:** How should law adapt to AI training?
- **Technical mechanisms:** Consent infrastructure, metadata standards, enforcement
- **Economic models:** Creator compensation, platform business cases, market dynamics
- **Ethical considerations:** Fair use vs. consent, cultural appropriation, power imbalances
- **Social implications:** Impact on creative communities, commons sustainability

**Special focus:** The Palimpsest License as case study (but submissions need not endorse it—critical analysis welcome)

---

**Summary (500 words):**

Artificial intelligence systems are trained on billions of creative works scraped from the internet without creator consent or compensation.
