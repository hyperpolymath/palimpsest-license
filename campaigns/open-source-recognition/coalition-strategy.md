# Coalition-Building Strategy: Open Source Recognition Campaign

## Executive Summary

The success of consent-layer licensing recognition depends on building a diverse, credible coalition spanning:
- **Creative communities** (writers, artists, musicians)
- **Open source advocates** (developers, foundations, thought leaders)
- **Legal experts** (IP scholars, tech law practitioners, policy makers)
- **AI ethics organisations** (researchers, advocacy groups, policy institutes)
- **Platform providers** (GitHub, GitLab, NPM, PyPI)

This document outlines our coalition-building strategy: who to engage, how to engage them, what benefits to emphasise, and how to sustain the coalition through a 24-month campaign.

**Goal:** 200+ organisational endorsements and 10,000+ individual supporters by Month 24.

## 2. Engagement Playbook

### A. Initial Outreach (Months 1-3)

#### Step 1: Research
Before contacting an organisation:
- **Understand their mission:** How does Palimpsest align?
- **Identify decision-makers:** Who can greenlight an endorsement?
- **Review past positions:** Have they addressed AI licensing, creator rights, or related issues?
- **Find mutual connections:** Warm introductions > cold emails

#### Step 2: Craft Tailored Pitch

**Template:**
```
Subject: [Organisation] + Palimpsest: Protecting Creators in the AI Era

Dear [Name],

I'm writing on behalf of the Palimpsest License project, a new consent-layer licensing framework designed to protect creative works from exploitative AI training whilst preserving the collaborative commons.

Why this matters for [Organisation]:
- [Specific alignment with their mission, e.g., "Creative Commons champions creator rights—Palimpsest extends those principles to AI training contexts"]
- [Specific benefit, e.g., "Your 2 billion CC-licensed works need protection from unauthorised AI training—Palimpsest provides that"]
- [Specific ask, e.g., "We're seeking organisational endorsements for our OSI recognition campaign"]

What we're asking:
- [Endorsement | Partnership | Dialogue]
- [Timeline, e.g., "We'd love to include [Organisation] in our Month 3 endorsement announcement"]

What's in it for [Organisation]:
- [Leadership in AI-era licensing | Association with ethical AI movement | Influence on OSI policy]

Can we schedule a 30-minute call to explore this?

Best regards,
[Name]
Palimpsest Stewardship Council
```

#### Step 3: Follow-Up
- **Day 7:** Gentle reminder if no response
- **Day 14:** Final follow-up ("We're moving forward soon; would love [Org] to be part of this")
- **Day 21:** If still no response, mark as "not interested" and move on

---

### C. Sustaining the Coalition (Months 13-24)

#### Challenge: Maintaining Engagement

Organisations endorse, then move on. How to keep them engaged?

**Solutions:**

1. **Regular Updates:**
   - Monthly newsletter: "Coalition Update"
   - Highlight: New endorsements, media coverage, OSI progress, success stories
   - Call to action: Share on social media, contact your networks, etc.

2. **Tiered Engagement Levels:**
   - **Endorsers** (passive): Listed on website, receive updates
   - **Partners** (active): Working groups, co-hosted events, joint advocacy
   - **Funders** (financial): Contribute to campaign budget, get recognition

3. **Recognition Programme:**
   - "Coalition Spotlight" series: Monthly profile of a partner organisation
   - Annual awards: "Most Impactful Partner," "Community Champion," etc.
   - Thank-you events: Virtual/in-person gatherings

4. **Concrete Asks:**
   - Don't just update—ask for action:
     - "This month: Email OSI board members (template attached)"
     - "This month: Share our new op-ed on LinkedIn"
     - "This month: Adopt Palimpsest for your organisation's creative output"

---

## 3. Messaging Framework

Different stakeholders care about different things. Tailor messaging accordingly.

### For Open Source Advocates

**Core Message:** *"Consent layers are the next evolution of copyleft—protecting creators without abandoning openness."*

**Key Points:**
- GPL showed that conditional freedom sustains the commons
- Palimpsest extends that principle to AI training
- Not DRM, not anti-sharing—it's structured permission
- OSI recognition legitimises creator protections

**Evidence:**
- License comparison (Palimpsest vs. GPL/MIT/Apache)
- Legal opinions confirming enforceability
- Real-world adoption (1,000+ users)

---

### For Creative Communities

**Core Message:** *"Palimpsest protects your work from AI exploitation whilst keeping it shareable."*

**Key Points:**
- AI companies are training on your writing/art/music without consent
- Traditional licenses (CC BY, etc.) don't address this
- Palimpsest requires AI companies to ask permission
- You keep all rights; you just add a consent layer

**Evidence:**
- Creator testimonials ("Palimpsest gave me control again")
- Enforcement case studies (successful cease-and-desist)
- Simple adoption guide ("Add one file to your repo")

---

### For Legal Experts

**Core Message:** *"Palimpsest is legally robust, enforceable, and fills a gap in IP law."*

**Key Points:**
- Uses established copyright mechanisms
- Consent framework aligns with contract law, GDPR
- Distinguishable from DRM under DMCA/EU Copyright Directive
- Multiple jurisdictions confirm enforceability (UK, EU, US, Canada, Australia)

**Evidence:**
- Legal opinions from 5 experts
- Case law analogies (music sampling, software piracy)
- Drafting precision (no ambiguous clauses)

---

### For AI Developers

**Core Message:** *"Consent infrastructure makes AI development more ethical, defensible, and sustainable."*

**Key Points:**
- Scraping without consent creates legal risk (lawsuits, regulatory action)
- Palimpsest provides clear permission pathways
- Ethical AI is better AI (higher-quality datasets, public trust)
- Early adopters gain competitive advantage ("We respect creators")

**Evidence:**
- Business case study (cost of litigation vs. cost of consent)
- Consent registry prototype (easy API integration)
- Examples of ethical AI companies (e.g., Stability AI's opt-out system)

---

### For Policy Makers

**Core Message:** *"Palimpsest demonstrates market-driven solutions to AI governance challenges."*

**Key Points:**
- Voluntary licensing > heavy-handed regulation
- Palimpsest aligns with EU AI Act, UK Online Safety Bill
- Scalable globally (not jurisdiction-specific)
- Reduces need for litigation (consent prevents disputes)

**Evidence:**
- Policy brief on consent infrastructure
- Comparative analysis (Palimpsest vs. regulatory approaches)
- Industry adoption numbers (shows market demand)

---

- Endorsement secured
- Partnership formalised
- Not interested

---

## 7. Conflict Resolution

### Anticipated Conflicts

**Scenario 1: FSF Opposes Palimpsest**

**Concern:** "Consent layers violate freedom—users should be able to do anything."

**Response:**
- Respectful disagreement: "GPL also restricts (share-alike). We extend that logic."
- Agree to disagree: "We can coexist—GPL for software, Palimpsest for creative works."
- Avoid public feud: "We respect FSF's position. Here's why we see it differently."

**Strategy:**
- Don't make FSF endorsement a prerequisite for OSI
- Highlight other credible allies (CC, EFF, Mozilla)
- Frame as philosophical diversity, not division

---

**Scenario 2: AI Companies Reject Consent Infrastructure**

**Concern:** "Too burdensome, slows innovation, legally murky."

**Response:**
- Business case: "Litigation is more burdensome than consent."
- Ethical differentiation: "Consent is a competitive advantage."
- Regulatory inevitability: "Governments will mandate this—better to lead than follow."

**Strategy:**
- Target ethical AI companies first (Anthropic, Hugging Face)
- Build proof of concept (consent registry works smoothly)
- Public pressure: Dataset audits naming violators

---

**Scenario 3: Coalition Members Disagree on Strategy**

**Example:** Creative Commons wants Palimpsest to prohibit commercial AI training; open source advocates want no commercial restrictions.

**Response:**
- Return to core principle: "Palimpsest allows commercial use but requires consent."
- Find compromise: "Commercial AI companies can license Palimpsest works—but must ask."
- Steering Committee vote if unresolved
