## Contingency: If OSI Doesn't Approve

### Plan B: Independent Recognition Network

**Months 24-30:**
1. **Create "Creative Source Initiative" (CSI):**
   - Alternative to OSI for creative licensing
   - Governance model: Creators, legal experts, technologists
   - Mission: Recognise licenses that protect creators in AI era

2. **Platform Adoption Without OSI:**
   - GitHub/GitLab/NPM can add Palimpsest without OSI approval
   - SPDX can assign identifier independently
   - Build momentum through usage, not official recognition

3. **Legal Precedent:**
   - Win 5 enforcement cases
   - Demonstrate Palimpsest is enforceable regardless of OSI

4. **Reframe Narrative:**
   - "OSI is for software; Palimpsest is for creative works"
   - Position as complementary, not competing

**Outcome:**
- Palimpsest succeeds without OSI
- OSI's relevance to creative licensing diminishes
- New organisation (CSI) becomes authority

- Credible evidence (legal opinions, academic research, real-world adoption)
- Strategic patience (OSI approval takes time)
- Contingency planning (Plan B if OSI resists)

**By Month 24, consent-layer licensing will be recognised—either by OSI, or by the broader ecosystem that moves forward without them.**
