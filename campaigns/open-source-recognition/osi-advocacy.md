# Why OSI Should Recognise Consent-Layer Licenses: An Advocacy Brief

## Executive Summary

The Open Source Initiative (OSI) stands at a crossroads. Artificial intelligence has created a new category of use—pattern extraction from creative works—that existing open source licenses never anticipated. Consent-layer licenses like Palimpsest address this gap whilst preserving the collaborative spirit that has always defined the commons.

We advocate for OSI to:
1. **Recognise consent-layer licenses as a legitimate category** alongside permissive and copyleft
2. **Update the Open Source Definition** to accommodate AI-era use cases
3. **Lead the conversation** on ethical licensing for creative works in the age of AI
4. **Expand beyond software** to support creative commons more broadly

This brief explains why these changes align with OSI's historical mission, benefit the broader ecosystem, and position OSI as a leader in next-generation licensing.

---

## 1. The Historical Precedent: OSI Has Evolved Before

### OSI's Original Mission (1998)

When OSI was founded, it addressed a specific problem: proprietary software restricting users' freedoms. The Open Source Definition (OSD) codified principles that enabled:
- Collaborative development
- Knowledge sharing
- Innovation through transparency
- User empowerment

**These principles remain valid. The question is how to apply them to new contexts.**

### OSI's Past Adaptations

OSI has never been static. It has evolved to address new challenges:

#### 2000s: The Patent Question
- **Challenge:** Software patents threatened open source projects
- **Response:** OSI approved Apache 2.0, which included explicit patent grants
- **Lesson:** When technology creates new risks, licensing must adapt

#### 2007: The Network Copyleft Problem
- **Challenge:** SaaS companies used GPL software without distributing binaries (thus avoiding copyleft)
- **Response:** OSI approved AGPL 3.0, which extended copyleft to network use
- **Lesson:** New deployment models require new license terms

#### 2010s: The Ethical Licensing Debate
- **Challenge:** Projects wanted to prohibit use by ICE, military, or unethical actors
- **Response:** OSI clarified that "no discrimination" is core to OSD—but the conversation advanced understanding
- **Lesson:** Boundaries exist, but they should be principled, not arbitrary

### The AI Challenge Is the Next Evolution

Just as patents and SaaS required new licensing mechanisms, **AI training requires consent infrastructure**.

The question isn't whether OSI should change—it's whether OSI will lead the change or be left behind.

## 2. Why the Open Source Definition Needs Updating

### The Current OSD (Ten Criteria)

We respect the OSD's intent. But several criteria need clarification for AI-era use cases:

#### Criterion 6: "No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavour"

**Current language:**
> "The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavour. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research."

**The AI problem:**
Is "training a neural network" a *field of endeavour* (like business or genetics), or a *form of consumption* (like compiling source code)?

**Our argument:**
- Fields of endeavour = business, education, healthcare, research
- Forms of consumption = reading, compiling, transforming, extracting patterns

AI training is not analogous to *using* software in a business. It's analogous to *creating derivatives* from source code—which GPL already restricts (you must share those derivatives).

**Proposed clarification:**
> "The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the work in a specific field of endeavour. However, licenses may impose conditions on derivative work creation, including restrictions on automated pattern extraction (e.g., AI training) provided such restrictions are transparent and consent-based."

#### Criterion 1: "Free Redistribution"

**Current language:**
> "The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software..."

**The AI problem:**
Does "giving away" include "ingesting into a training dataset"?

**Our argument:**
Distribution traditionally means providing a copy to another party who can then use it. AI training *consumes* the work to create a model—it doesn't distribute the work itself.

**Proposed clarification:**
> "Free redistribution refers to providing copies of the work to others for their use. Transformation of the work into derivative forms (including pattern extraction for AI training) may be subject to additional consent requirements."

### Why These Updates Strengthen OSD

**They don't weaken openness—they clarify it.**

- GPL doesn't violate Criterion 6 by restricting proprietary derivatives
- AGPL doesn't violate Criterion 1 by requiring source disclosure for network use
- Palimpsest doesn't violate either by requiring consent for NI system training

All three impose *conditions on specific use types* whilst preserving broad freedom.

## 3. The Case for Consent-Layer Recognition

### What Is a Consent Layer?

A **consent-layer license**:
- Permits broad use for human-directed purposes
- Requires explicit permission for automated pattern extraction (AI training)
- Preserves attribution and lineage through derivatives
- Balances creator protection with cultural commons

**It's not DRM.** It's not anti-sharing. It's **structured permission** for emerging technologies.

### Why Consent Layers Align with Open Source Values

| Open Source Value | How Consent Layers Uphold It |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Transparency** | AI training must be disclosed; datasets should be auditable |
| **Collaboration** | Derivatives encouraged—but with metadata preservation |
| **Attribution** | Extends beyond simple credit to emotional/cultural lineage |
| **Community governance** | Stewardship Council model mirrors OSI, Apache Foundation, Linux Foundation |
| **Sustainability** | Enables creators to participate without fear of exploitation |
| **Innovation** | Ethical constraints drive better AI development (like GDPR improved data practices) |

### Distinguishing Consent Layers from Problematic Restrictions

**What consent layers ARE NOT:**

❌ **Ethical use clauses** ("no military use," "no ICE contracts")
- **Problem:** Arbitrary, subjective, hard to enforce
- **Consent layers:** Technology-neutral, behaviour-based (pattern extraction), objectively verifiable

❌ **Digital rights management (DRM)**
- **Problem:** Technical restriction mechanisms that limit user control
- **Consent layers:** Legal requirement for permission, not technical lockdown

❌ **Commercial restrictions** ("no commercial use")
- **Problem:** Limits economic activity, incompatible with OSD Criterion 6
- **Consent layers:** Commercial use fully allowed—it's the *method* of use (NI systems) that requires consent

**What consent layers ARE:**

✅ **Analogous to copyleft** (GPL, AGPL)
- Both impose conditions on derivative creation
- Both use copyright enforcement
- Both aim to sustain the commons

✅ **Responsive to new technology** (like AGPL was for SaaS)
- AI training is a new use case
- Existing licenses don't address it
- Consent layers fill the gap

✅ **Creator-centric** (like contributor agreements)
- Contributors grant permission for project use
- AI developers should grant permission for training use
- Both are consent mechanisms

## 4. Benefits of OSI Recognition

### For Creators

1. **Legal legitimacy:** OSI approval signals robustness
2. **Ecosystem integration:** Package managers, Git hosts recognise OSI-approved licenses
3. **Clarity:** Creators know Palimpsest is "real," not experimental
4. **Community:** Join the open source movement as full participants

### For AI Developers

1. **Clear consent pathways:** No legal ambiguity about whether training is allowed
2. **Reduced litigation risk:** Following an OSI-recognised license is defensible
3. **Ethical differentiation:** "We only train on consented data" becomes a competitive advantage
4. **Industry standards:** OSI recognition encourages broader adoption, creating uniform practices

### For the Commons

1. **Sustainable participation:** Creators contribute knowing they won't be exploited
2. **Cultural preservation:** Emotional lineage protects vulnerable narratives
3. **Quality datasets:** Consent infrastructure means better-curated training data
4. **Precedent:** Establishes that new technologies require new licensing—future-proofs the commons

### For OSI

1. **Relevance:** Positions OSI as leader in AI-era licensing (not just software)
2. **Influence:** Shapes how industry handles consent and attribution
3. **Expansion:** Attracts creative communities (writers, artists, musicians) to open source principles
4. **Legacy:** Just as OSI championed software freedom in the '90s, it can champion creative freedom in the 2020s

## 5. Addressing Anticipated Objections

### Objection 1: "This is too different from traditional open source."

**Response:**
- AGPL was "too different" (network copyleft was novel)
- Apache's patent grant was "too different" (legal complexity)
- Every major license evolution faced this criticism

**The standard isn't "sameness"—it's "alignment with principles."**

Palimpsest aligns with transparency, attribution, collaboration, and sustainability. That's what matters.

---

### Objection 2: "It's unenforceable—how do you prove AI training?"

**Response:**
- GPL enforcement also requires proof (binary distribution, derivative creation)
- Copyright law has handled complex proof requirements for decades (sampling in music, plagiarism in text)
- Emerging techniques make AI training detectable:
  - Watermarking datasets
  - Model memorization analysis
  - Legal discovery of training logs

**If unenforceability disqualified licenses, we'd reject GPL too.**

---

### Objection 3: "This will fragment the ecosystem."

**Response:**
- Fragmentation already exists (MIT vs. GPL vs. Creative Commons)
- Palimpsest doesn't replace anything—it **adds a category**
- License proliferation is bad; category proliferation is necessary (permissive, copyleft, consent-layer)

**OSI's role is to curate categories, not restrict their number.**

---

### Objection 4: "Consent is too subjective—how do you define it?"

**Response:**
- Contract law, medical ethics, and GDPR all rely on consent
- Palimpsest defines consent explicitly: written agreement, scope of use, revocability
- No more subjective than GPL's "derivative work" or Apache's "patent grant"

**Licenses always require interpretation. That's why we have courts and legal experts.**

---

### Objection 5: "This hurts AI innovation."

**Response:**
- GDPR didn't kill the internet—it improved data practices
- Accessibility laws didn't kill web development—they improved UX
- Ethical constraints drive **better** innovation

**Free-for-all data scraping isn't innovation—it's extraction.**

Consent infrastructure encourages:
- Higher-quality training datasets (curated, not scraped)
- Transparent AI development (auditable, trustworthy)
- Sustainable creator ecosystems (people keep contributing)

---

### Objection 6: "OSI only covers software, not creative works."

**Response:**
This is a choice, not a necessity.

- OSI's principles (transparency, collaboration, attribution) apply to all creative output
- Code is a creative work—just specialised
- Expanding to broader creative licensing increases OSI's influence and relevance

**Alternative:** If OSI won't expand, it should partner with Creative Commons to co-recognise consent-layer licenses.

---

## 6. Proposed OSI Actions

### Phase 1: Acknowledge the Problem (Months 1-3)

**Actions:**
1. **Publish a blog post:** "AI Training and Open Source Licensing: A Conversation Starter"
2. **Host a webinar:** Invite AI ethicists, creators, legal experts, AI developers
3. **Survey the community:** Do open source developers see AI training as a concern?
4. **Commission legal analysis:** How do existing licenses apply to AI training? (Spoiler: they don't)

**Outcome:** Establish that AI training is a real, unaddressed issue.

---

### Phase 2: Explore Solutions (Months 4-9)

**Actions:**
1. **Form a working group:** "AI-Era Licensing" (include Palimpsest authors, Creative Commons, AI researchers)
2. **Draft OSD amendments:** Clarify Criteria 1 and 6 for AI contexts
3. **Develop evaluation criteria:** How to distinguish consent layers from DRM/ethical clauses
4. **Review Palimpsest:** Formal submission and community feedback

**Outcome:** Clear framework for evaluating consent-layer licenses.

---

### Phase 3: Recognise Consent-Layer Category (Months 10-15)

**Actions:**
1. **Approve Palimpsest** (or revise it based on feedback)
2. **Update OSI website:** Add "consent-layer" to license categories
3. **Publish guidance:** When to use permissive, copyleft, or consent-layer licenses
4. **Integrate into tools:** SPDX identifiers, choosealicense.com, GitHub/GitLab license pickers

**Outcome:** Consent-layer licenses are legitimate, recognised, and usable.

---

### Phase 4: Industry Adoption (Months 16-24)

**Actions:**
1. **Partner with platforms:** GitHub, GitLab, NPM, PyPI add Palimpsest to license options
2. **Engage AI companies:** OpenAI, Google, Meta adopt consent infrastructure
3. **Legal precedent:** Support test cases enforcing consent-layer licenses
4. **International reach:** Work with European, Asian, African regulators on AI consent frameworks

**Outcome:** Consent layers become industry standard for creative works.

---

## 7. Strategic Alignment with OSI's Mission

### OSI's Stated Goals

From OSI's mission statement:
> "The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a global non-profit that supports and promotes the open source definition and the community of software creators and users."

**How consent-layer recognition serves this mission:**

1. **Supports creators:** Protects them from AI exploitation whilst keeping work shareable
2. **Promotes openness:** Extends open principles to AI-era contexts
3. **Defines boundaries:** Just as OSD defines "open source," consent layers define "ethical AI use"
4. **Builds community:** Attracts creative communities (broader than just software devs)

### OSI's Values

- **Transparency:** Consent layers require AI training disclosure
- **Collaboration:** Metadata preservation enables derivative lineage tracking
- **Meritocracy:** Best ideas win—if consent layers solve real problems, they deserve recognition
- **Pragmatism:** "It works" > "It's ideologically pure"—consent layers are practical

**Recognising consent layers is not a betrayal of values—it's an application of values to new contexts.**

---

## 8. Coalition-Building Opportunities

### Potential Partners

**Creative Commons:**
- Shared concern: AI training on CC-licensed works
- Collaboration: Co-develop metadata standards
- Joint position: Creative Commons endorses consent layers for AI-era protections

**Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF):**
- Shared concern: User rights in AI systems
- Collaboration: Legal framework for consent enforcement
- Joint position: Consent layers protect individual autonomy

**Writers Guild, Artists' Unions, Musicians' Collectives:**
- Shared concern: AI-generated content undermining livelihoods
- Collaboration: Advocacy for consent infrastructure
- Joint position: Creators support OSI's consent-layer category

**AI Ethics Organisations (e.g., Partnership on AI, AI Now Institute):**
- Shared concern: Responsible AI development
- Collaboration: Best practices for consent mechanisms
- Joint position: Ethical AI requires consent infrastructure

**Academic Institutions:**
- Shared concern: Research datasets need clear licensing
- Collaboration: Case studies, legal analysis, tool development
- Joint position: Consent layers enable ethical AI research

### Messaging Alignment

**To all partners:**
"OSI's recognition of consent-layer licenses creates infrastructure for sustainable, ethical AI development. It's good for creators, good for developers, good for the commons."

---

## 9. Risk Analysis

### What If OSI Says No?

**Plan B: Independent Ecosystem**
1. Palimpsest builds its own recognition network:
   - Creative Commons partnership
   - Platform adoption (GitHub, GitLab)
   - Legal precedent through enforcement
2. OSI becomes irrelevant to creative licensing (loses influence)
3. Another organisation (e.g., "Creative Source Initiative") forms to fill the gap

**Long-term consequence:**
- OSI remains software-focused, misses broader cultural impact
- Consent layers succeed anyway (because they solve real problems)
- OSI's legacy as a licensing leader diminishes

**We'd rather have OSI lead this evolution.**

---

### What If OSI Says Yes?

**Likely outcomes:**
1. **Short-term controversy:** Some community members resist change
2. **Medium-term adoption:** Creators embrace consent layers; AI companies build consent infrastructure
3. **Long-term norm:** "Did you get consent?" becomes standard question, like "What's the license?"

**Historical parallel:**
- When AGPL was approved, critics said it was "too restrictive"
- Today, AGPL is standard for SaaS projects wanting copyleft
- It didn't fragment the ecosystem—it **expanded it**

**Consent layers will follow the same trajectory.**

---

---

## 11. Conclusion: A Licensing Framework for the Future

OSI has always been about **power**—who has it, who abuses it, and how we redistribute it through licensing.

In the 1990s, power meant controlling source code. OSI broke those gates open.

In the 2020s, power means controlling how creative works feed AI systems. Consent-layer licenses break those gates open too.

**This is the same fight. Just a new front.**

We invite OSI to lead. Recognise consent-layer licenses. Update the Open Source Definition. Build the future of ethical licensing.

The commons will be stronger for it.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Draft OSD Amendment Text

**Criterion 1: Free Redistribution (Proposed Amendment)**

> The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the work as a component of an aggregate distribution containing works from several different sources. However, licenses may impose conditions on derivative work creation, including requirements for consent when using the work for automated pattern extraction (e.g., machine learning training), provided such conditions are transparent, technology-neutral, and enforce attribution/lineage preservation.

**Criterion 6: No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavour (Proposed Clarification)**

> The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the work in a specific field of endeavour (e.g., business, research, education). However, licenses may distinguish between different *forms* of use (e.g., direct use vs. derivative creation vs. pattern extraction), provided such distinctions are objectively defined and serve to preserve attribution, transparency, or creator consent.

---

### Appendix B: Endorsement Template

**For Organisations Supporting Consent-Layer Recognition:**

> [Organisation Name] supports the Open Source Initiative's exploration of consent-layer licensing for AI-era creative works. We believe that requiring consent for AI training is consistent with open source values of transparency, attribution, and sustainable collaboration. We encourage OSI to recognise the Palimpsest License and similar frameworks as legitimate tools for protecting creators whilst preserving the commons.
