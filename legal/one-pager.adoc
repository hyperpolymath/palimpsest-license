== Purpose

The Palimpsest‑MPL License is a modern, provenance‑aware, ethically grounded license designed for creators working with narrative, symbolic, cultural, or emotionally significant materials.  
It extends the Mozilla Public License with:

* provenance integrity  
* emotional lineage protection  
* ethical‑use constraints  
* optional quantum‑safe cryptography  
* structured exhibits for domain‑specific guidance  

== Jurisdiction

Primary governing law: **Netherlands**  
Secondary jurisdictions: **UK (England & Wales, Scotland), EU, US**

== Key Innovations

* **Provenance Layer**  
  Cryptographic signatures, lineage metadata, and audit tooling.

* **Ethical Use Layer**  
  Constraints on misuse, distortion, or harmful deployment of creative works.

* **Exhibits System**  
  Modular extensions (e.g., quantum‑safe cryptography, cultural heritage guidance).

* **SCM Manifests**  
  Six machine‑readable governance files enabling auditability and agentic tooling.

== Legal Validation Strategy

* Engage Dutch copyright experts (IViR, De Brauw, NautaDutilh).  
* Seek academic validation (IViR, Max Planck, Stanford CIS, Berkman Klein).  
* Align with digital rights organisations (Bits of Freedom, EDRi, EFF).  
* Commission certified Dutch translation for legal enforceability.
