= Test‑Case Development Framework – Palimpsest License
:toc: macro

This framework outlines how to identify, prepare, and execute legal test cases to validate and enforce the Palimpsest‑MPL License.

toc::[]

== Objectives

* Establish enforceability under Dutch law (primary jurisdiction).
* Validate provenance and ethical‑use clauses.
* Create precedent for platform accountability.
* Support policy advocacy with real‑world examples.

== Test‑Case Categories

=== 1. Provenance Stripping
Scenario:
A platform or AI system removes provenance metadata or signatures.

Legal Questions:
* Does this violate Dutch moral rights?  
* Does it breach license terms?  

Evidence Needed:
* Original artefact with metadata  
* Platform output without metadata  
* Logs, screenshots, timestamps  

=== 2. Unethical Use or Distortion
Scenario:
A work is used in a harmful, misleading, or decontextualised way.

Legal Questions:
* Does this violate ethical‑use constraints?  
* Does it infringe moral rights?  

Evidence Needed:
* Original work  
* Misused output  
* Harm analysis  

=== 3. Unauthorized Commercial Use
Scenario:
A company uses a PMPL‑licensed work without complying with provenance or exhibit requirements.

Legal Questions:
* Is this a breach of license?  
* Is it copyright infringement?  

Evidence Needed:
* Proof of use  
* Missing compliance steps  
* Commercial context  

== Test‑Case Workflow

. Identify candidate case  
. Gather evidence  
. Conduct legal analysis  
. Consult honest brokers  
. Prepare legal brief  
. Engage pro bono counsel  
. Decide on:
  * negotiation  
  * takedown  
  * regulatory complaint  
  * litigation (rare, last resort)  

== Governance

All test cases require approval by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council.  
Confidentiality rules apply (see `legal/README.adoc`).
