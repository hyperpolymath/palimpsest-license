= Migration Note – Markdown to AsciiDoc Conversion

All legal documents previously written in Markdown (`.md`) have been fully replaced with canonical AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) versions.

== Rationale

* AsciiDoc is the primary documentation format for the Palimpsest ecosystem.
* It supports:
  - structured legal drafting  
  - cross‑references  
  - tables and metadata  
  - GitHub Pages integration  
  - long‑form legal analysis  

== Scope of Migration

The following directories were fully converted:

* `legal/pro-bono/organisations/`
* `legal/pro-bono/contacts/`
* `legal/pro-bono/letters/`
* `legal/strategy/`
* `legal/frameworks/`
* `legal/annexes/`
* `legal/translations/`
* `legal/reference-schemes/`

All `.md` files have been removed.

== Canonical Format

AsciiDoc (`.adoc`) is now the **only** authoritative format for legal documentation.

== Version Control

All rewritten files include:

* SPDX headers  
* consistent metadata  
* cross‑links to related documents  

== Review

This migration was approved by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council.
