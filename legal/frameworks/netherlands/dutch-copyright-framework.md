**Palimpsest Enhancement:**
| Dutch Law (Art. 25) | Palimpsest License |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Attribution of name | Attribution + emotional lineage |
| Object to modifications | Preserve symbolic texture |
| Derogatory treatment | Cultural derogation, narrative debt |
| Inalienable | Persistent ethical obligation |

- Palimpsest DAO = innovative collective governance

**Colonial Provenance:**
- Restitution debates (colonial artefacts)
- Ethical duties beyond legal ownership

- Harmonised EU terminology (English/Dutch)
- Academic consensus (IViR, IVIR Nederlands Juristenblad)

### 14.2 Bilingual Licensing

**Palimpsest Model:**
- Dutch version: legally binding in Netherlands
- English version: informative, internationally accessible
- Clause alignment: structural parallelism
- Terminology consistency: bilingual lexicon

**Dispute Resolution:**
- Specify prevailing version (Dutch in Dutch courts)
- Interpretation principles (Art. 6:234 BW: *Haviltex* formula — parties' reasonable expectations)
