- Cross-fertilisation with English case law

**Scots Law Distinctiveness:**
- Property law (*dominium*, real rights vs personal rights)
- Contract law (consensus-based; less emphasis on consideration)
- Delict (not tort)
- Equity incorporated differently (Court of Session equitable jurisdiction)

## 3. Copyright Law Application in Scotland

### 3.1 Statutory Framework

**Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988:**
- Applies throughout United Kingdom
- Identical substantive provisions in Scotland
- Interpretation may differ due to Scots law context

**Key Provisions (Scotland-Specific Notes):**

**Section 11 (First Ownership):**
- Employment test: Scots employment law principles
- *Contract of service* vs *contract for services* (Scots distinction)

---

## 4. Contract Law and Licensing

### 4.1 Scots Contract Law Principles

**Consensus in Idem:**
- Agreement = meeting of minds (consensus)
- Less emphasis on consideration than English law
- *Unilateral obligation* concept (promise without consideration)

**Palimpsest License as Scots Contract:**
- Offer: licensor provides work under terms
- Acceptance: licensee's use of work
- Consensus: agreement to licence terms
- Consideration: not essential in Scots law (obligation enforceable if sufficiently clear)

### 4.2 Restrictive Covenants and Public Policy

**Reasonableness Test:**
- Similar to English law but distinct doctrinal basis
- *Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd* [1894] AC 535 (applies in Scotland)
- Public interest considerations (*pacta non sunt servanda contra bonos mores*)

**AI Training Restrictions:**
- Novel area; no Scottish case law

---

## 5. Delict and Infringement

### 5.1 Scots Law of Delict

**Not "Tort":**
- Scots law: delict (wrongful conduct causing loss)
- Similar outcomes to English tort but different conceptual framework

**Institutional Writers:**
- Stair: *injuria* (wrongful conduct) + *damnum* (loss) = reparation
- Erskine: delict as breach of natural or positive obligation

### 5.2 Copyright Infringement as Delict/Statutory Wrong

**CDPA Framework:**
- Statutory regime (ss 16-27)
- Remedies (ss 96-102) apply in Scotland

**Scots Interpretation:**
- Infringement = statutory delict
- Damages: reparation for patrimonial loss
- Solatium: non-patrimonial loss (e.g., injury to reputation)

### 5.3 Moral Rights and Delict

**Personality Rights:**
- Civilian influence: protection of personality (*ius personarum*)
- Moral rights align with civilian personality rights tradition
- **Scotland's civilian heritage makes moral rights conceptually compatible**

**Honour and Reputation:**
- Integrity right (CDPA s 80): "prejudicial to honour or reputation"
- Scots delict: *injuria* (affront to honour)
- Stronger theoretical basis in Scots law than English law

---

### 6.2 Damages and Solatium

**Damages (Patrimonial Loss):**
- Compensatory principle
- Hypothetical licence fee (user principle)
- Loss of profit

**Solatium (Non-Patrimonial Loss):**
- Scots law concept: compensation for injury to feelings, reputation
- Moral rights infringement: solatium for injury to honour
- *Palimpsest emotional lineage:* arguably engages solatium principle

### 6.3 Account of Profits

**Equitable Remedy in English Law:**
- Historically equitable (Chancery jurisdiction)
- Court of Session has inherent *nobile officium* (equitable power)
- CDPA s 96(2): account of profits available in Scotland

---

## 7. Palimpsest-Specific Scottish Analysis

### 7.1 Emotional Lineage and Civilian Tradition

**Civilian Personality Rights:**
- Continental European tradition: *droit moral*, *Urheberpersönlichkeitsrecht*
- Scots law's civilian heritage provides conceptual affinity
- **Emotional lineage = extension of personality protection**

**Institutional Writers on Honour:**
- Stair, *Institutions* I.9.4: honour as inherent human attribute
- Protection of honour deeply rooted in Scots law
- Palimpsest's honour/reputation protection aligns with civilian principles

### 7.2 Cultural Heritage and Scots Identity

**Scottish Cultural Context:**
- Strong tradition of cultural preservation (Gaelic language, Highland culture)
- Diaspora narratives (Highland Clearances, emigration)
- Symbolic importance of cultural lineage

**Palimpsest Resonance:**

- Conflict of laws: Scots courts apply *lex fori* (forum law) or *lex causae* (law of cause)

**Palimpsest Primary Jurisdiction (Netherlands):**
- Scots courts recognise foreign choice of law (Rome I Regulation, retained EU law)
- Dutch law may govern contract
- Scots courts may apply Dutch law to Palimpsest disputes

**Scottish Cultural Connection:**

## 8. AI and Computational Use: Scottish Perspective

### 8.1 Text and Data Mining

**CDPA Sections 29A-29B:**
- Apply in Scotland (UK-wide statute)
- Non-commercial TDM exception (s 29A)
- Commercial TDM with lawful access (s 29B, if implemented)

**Scottish Court Interpretation:**
- No Scottish case law yet on TDM
- Likely to follow English precedents (common statutory framework)
- Civilian interpretive approach may emphasise purposive reading

### 8.2 Computer-Generated Works

**Section 9(3) Author:**
- "Person by whom arrangements necessary for creation of work are undertaken"
- Scots contract/employment law may affect determination
- No Scottish case law on AI authorship

**Scots Contract Law Enforceability:**
- Contractual restriction on AI use
- Freedom of contract principle robust in Scots law
- No statutory TDM override if contractual prohibition clear

**Public Policy Considerations:**
- Restraint of trade: unlikely to apply (restriction on use, not trade itself)
- *Pacta sunt servanda* (agreements must be kept) — fundamental Scots law principle

---

## 9. DAO Governance and Scots Law

### 9.1 Legal Personality

**Unincorporated Associations:**
- Scots law: unincorporated associations have distinct legal personality

- Members not personally liable (absent contrary agreement)

**DAO as Association:**
- Palimpsest DAO potentially has legal personality under Scots law
- Can own property, sue, and be sued
- Governance structure = rules of association

### 9.2 Smart Contracts

**Scots Contract Law:**
- Contract = consensus + intention to create legal relations
- Form: generally no writing required (except specific types)
- Smart contract = self-executing agreement

**Legal Recognition:**
- No Scottish case law on smart contracts
- Likely enforceable as ordinary contracts if consensus proven
- Code as expression of contractual terms

### 9.3 Palimpsest Stewardship Council

**Governance Body:**
- Council as management committee of association
- Fiduciary duties under Scots common law
