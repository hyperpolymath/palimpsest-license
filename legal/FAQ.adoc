== What is the Palimpsest‑MPL License?

A modern, provenance‑aware license built on the MPL, designed for creators working with narrative, symbolic, cultural, or emotionally significant materials.

== Why is Dutch law the primary jurisdiction?

The license was drafted with Dutch copyright principles in mind, especially moral rights, TDM exceptions, and the Auteurswet’s strong protections for creators.

== Is this license OSI‑approved?

Not yet. OSI approval is a long‑term goal after legal validation and academic review.

== How does this differ from MPL‑2.0?

* Adds provenance metadata and signature requirements  
* Adds ethical‑use constraints  
* Adds modular exhibits  
* Adds governance manifests  
* Adds neurosymbolic and agentic integration guidance  

== Is this a copyleft license?

Yes, but with a **file‑level** copyleft model inherited from MPL.

== Can commercial entities use Palimpsest‑licensed works?

Yes, provided they comply with:

* provenance requirements  
* ethical‑use constraints  
* exhibit‑specific obligations  

== What are “Exhibits”?

Modular extensions that clarify or extend the license.  
See `legal/exhibits/` and `spec/EXHIBITS-SPEC.adoc`.

== What is the provenance requirement?

Artefacts must include:

* SPDX headers  
* provenance metadata  
* optional cryptographic signatures  

See `spec/PROVENANCE-SPEC.adoc`.

== Do I need to sign artefacts?

Signing is recommended but not mandatory unless an exhibit requires it.

== How do I get legal help?

See:

* `legal/pro-bono/organisations/`  
* `legal/pro-bono/contacts/`  
* `legal/pro-bono/letters/`
