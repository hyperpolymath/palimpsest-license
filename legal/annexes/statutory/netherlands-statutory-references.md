## 9. Conclusion

The Netherlands provides comprehensive statutory support for the Palimpsest License:

1. **Strongest moral rights framework** (Art. 25: inalienable, automatic, comprehensive)
2. **TDM opt-out mechanism** (Art. 15i(3): contractual reservation expressly permitted)
3. **Rights management information protection** (Art. 29a: metadata preservation)
4. **Contract law principles** (BW 6:248: reasonableness and fairness mandatory)
5. **Fair remuneration for authors** (Art. 25d-h: DSM implementation)

This legal framework makes the Netherlands the **optimal primary jurisdiction** for Palimpsest License enforcement.
