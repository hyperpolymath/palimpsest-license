## 1. Authorship and Originality

### 1.1 "Author's Own Intellectual Creation" Standard

#### CJEU: *Infopaq International A/S v Danske Dagblades Forening*
**Citation:** Case C-5/08 [2009] ECLI:EU:C:2009:465
**Court:** Court of Justice of the European Union (Grand Chamber)
**Date:** 16 July 2009

**Holding:**
> Copyright subsists in works that are author's own intellectual creation, reflecting the author's personality through creative choices.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Establishes EU-wide harmonised originality standard
- Protects creative expression (not mere facts or data)
- Applies to text and data mining cases (AI training data)
- Supports Palimpsest protection of creative works with emotional lineage

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [37]: "Copyright ... is liable to apply only in relation to a subject-matter which is original in the sense that it is its author's own intellectual creation."
- [45]: Author's intellectual creation = elements reflecting author's personality

---

#### UK: *Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd v Meltwater Holding BV*
**Citation:** [2011] EWCA Civ 890; [2012] Bus LR 53
**Court:** Court of Appeal (England and Wales)
**Judges:** Lord Neuberger MR, Lewison LJ, Floyd LJ
**Date:** 27 July 2011

**Holding:**
> Applied *Infopaq* standard in UK. Headlines may be original literary works if sufficient skill and labour expended.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- UK courts apply EU harmonised standard
- Even short excerpts protected if original
- Metadata and contextual information may constitute original expression

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [21]: "Originality in the sense of 'the author's own intellectual creation' is now the appropriate test."
- [80-81]: Hypothetical licence fee appropriate damages measure (user principle)

---

#### Netherlands: *Van Dale v Romme*
**Citation:** Hoge Raad, 4 January 1991, ECLI:NL:HR:1991:ZC0109, NJ 1991, 608
**Court:** Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court)
**Date:** 4 January 1991

**Holding:**
> Work must bear "personal stamp of the author" (*persoonlijk stempel van de maker*) to be protected.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Pre-*Infopaq* Dutch originality standard
- "Personal stamp" concept aligns with emotional lineage
- Author's personality reflected in creative choices

**Key Principle:**
- Dutch originality standard emphasises author's personal contribution
- Higher standard than mere "skill and labour" (UK pre-*Infopaq*)
- Post-*Infopaq*, Dutch courts apply harmonised EU standard but retain personality emphasis

---

## 2. Moral Rights: Attribution (Paternity)

### 2.1 Right to Be Identified as Author

#### UK: *Sawkins v Hyperion Records Ltd*
**Citation:** [2005] EWCA Civ 565; [2005] 1 WLR 3281
**Court:** Court of Appeal (England and Wales)
**Judges:** Mummery LJ, Jacob LJ, Lloyd LJ
**Date:** 19 May 2005

**Holding:**
> Performing editions of out-of-copyright baroque music constituted original works. Author entitled to attribution.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Attribution right protects scholarly and creative contributions
- Even works derived from public domain material protected if original
- Supports Palimpsest requirement for attribution in derivative works

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [31]: Skill, labour, and judgment in creating performing edition = originality
- [78]: Paternity right enforceable; author entitled to be named

---

#### Netherlands: *Endstra Tapes*
**Citation:** Hoge Raad, 12 January 2001, ECLI:NL:HR:2001:AA9374, NJ 2001, 300
**Court:** Hoge Raad der Nederlanden
**Date:** 12 January 2001

**Holding:**
> Unauthorised publication of taped conversations violated moral rights. Context of publication critical to integrity assessment.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Dutch courts take moral rights seriously
- **Context matters:** Decontextualised publication may violate integrity
- Supports Palimpsest Clause 2.3 (contextual integrity and emotional lineage)

**Key Principle:**
- Publication in different context can be derogatory treatment
- Author's intended meaning and context must be preserved
- Aligns with Palimpsest emotional lineage protection

---

## 3. Moral Rights: Integrity

### 3.1 Derogatory Treatment and Contextual Integrity

#### UK: *Tidy v Trustees of Natural History Museum*
**Citation:** [1996] EWHC Patents 5; (1996) 39 IPR 501
**Court:** High Court of England and Wales (Patents Court)
**Judge:** Laddie J
**Date:** 1996

**Holding:**
> Integrity right requires objective assessment. Would reasonable person consider treatment prejudicial to author's honour/reputation?

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Establishes objective test for derogatory treatment
- Prejudice to honour/reputation as author (not general reputation)
- Supports Palimpsest integrity protections

**Key Principle:**
- Addition, deletion, alteration = "treatment"
- Derogatory if distortion, mutilation, or prejudice to honour
- Objective reasonable person standard (UK approach)

**Limitation for Palimpsest:**
- UK test may be narrower than Palimpsest emotional lineage concept
- Netherlands provides stronger subjective protection (Art. 25(1)(c)-(d))

---

#### UK: *Confetti Records v Warner Music UK Ltd*
**Citation:** [2003] EWHC 1274 (Ch); [2003] EMLR 35
**Court:** High Court of England and Wales (Chancery Division)
**Judge:** Lewison J
**Date:** 14 May 2003

**Holding:**
> Unauthorised sampling of rap performance violated integrity right. Treatment included incorporation into different work.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- **AI analogy:** Sampling similar to AI training data extraction
- Unauthorised use in different context = derogatory treatment
- Supports Palimpsest Clause 1.2 (consent required for NI systems)

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [150]: "Treatment" includes use of part of work in different context
- [153]: Commercial exploitation without consent may prejudice honour

---

#### Netherlands: *Eyeworks*
**Citation:** Gerechtshof Amsterdam, 24 June 2010, ECLI:NL:GHAMS:2010:BM9157
**Court:** Court of Appeal of Amsterdam
**Date:** 24 June 2010

**Holding:**
> Changes to TV format violated moral rights. Format changes prejudicial to author's vision and reputation.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Broader integrity protection than UK
- Author's artistic vision protected
- Format/context changes may violate integrity even if not "mutilation"

**Key Principle:**
- Dutch courts: modifications affecting author's artistic intent = violation
- Supports Palimpsest contextual integrity requirement
- Emotional lineage framework stronger in Dutch law

---

### 3.2 Metadata Stripping and Integrity

#### CJEU: *Painer v Standard VerlagsGmbH*
**Citation:** Case C-145/10 [2011] ECLI:EU:C:2011:798
**Court:** Court of Justice of the European Union (Third Chamber)
**Date:** 1 December 2011

**Holding:**
> Photographs protected if author makes creative choices (framing, lighting, angle, etc.). Removal of photographer's name may violate moral rights.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Attribution information removal = moral rights violation
- Supports Palimpsest Clause 2.3 (metadata preservation)
- Author's name and context essential to work's integrity

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [89-94]: Author's intellectual creation in photographs (creative choices)
- [101-103]: Moral rights protect author's connection to work

---

## 4. Fair Dealing, Quotation, and Transformative Use

### 4.1 Quotation Right and Source Acknowledgement

#### UK: *Newspaper Licensing Agency Ltd v Marks & Spencer plc*
**Citation:** [2001] UKHL 38; [2003] 1 AC 551
**Court:** House of Lords
**Lords:** Lord Bingham, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hope, Lord Hutton, Lord Walker
**Date:** 17 July 2001

**Holding:**
> Fair dealing for research or private study must be assessed on case-by-case basis. "Fairness" considers purpose, nature of work, amount taken, effect on market.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Fair dealing does not override attribution requirements
- Commercial context reduces likelihood of "fairness"
- Supports Palimpsest requirement for attribution even in exceptions

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [29-32]: Fairness assessment (multiple factors)
- [40-41]: Commercial use unlikely to be fair dealing

---

#### Netherlands: *Scientology*
**Citation:** Hoge Raad, 29 November 2002, ECLI:NL:HR:2002:AE7680, NJ 2003, 58
**Court:** Hoge Raad der Nederlanden
**Date:** 29 November 2002

**Holding:**
> Quotation for criticism protected under Art. 15a Auteurswet. Source indication required. Public interest in freedom of expression weighed against copyright.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- **Source indication mandatory** under Dutch law (Art. 15a)
- Even in quotation exception, author must be attributed
- Supports Palimpsest metadata preservation

**Key Principle:**
- Citaatrecht (quotation right) requires:
  - Public disclosure
  - Fair practice
  - Proportionate extent
  - **Source and author indication**

---

### 4.2 Parody Exception

#### CJEU: *Pelham GmbH v Hütter*
**Citation:** Case C-476/17 [2019] ECLI:EU:C:2019:624 (Metall auf Metall III)
**Court:** Court of Justice of the European Union (Grand Chamber)
**Date:** 29 July 2019

**Holding:**
> Parody must evoke existing work whilst being noticeably different. Must constitute expression of humour or mockery. Balance freedom of expression with moral rights.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Parody exception does not eliminate moral rights
- Derogatory treatment still prohibited if prejudicial to honour
- Supports Palimpsest position: exceptions do not override emotional lineage

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [71]: Parody must evoke existing work and be noticeably different
- [68-70]: Member States may protect moral rights even in parody context

---

## 5. AI, Text and Data Mining, and Computational Use

### 5.1 AI Training and Reproduction

#### UK: *Google LLC v Oracle America Inc* (US Supreme Court; persuasive)
**Citation:** 593 US ___ (2021); 141 S Ct 1183
**Court:** Supreme Court of the United States
**Justice:** Breyer J (majority)
**Date:** 5 April 2021

**Holding:**
> Google's use of Oracle's Java API in Android constituted fair use. Transformative purpose (new platform) and limited use (only declaring code) favoured fair use.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- **Persuasive (not binding) in UK/Netherlands**
- Transformative use concept may apply to AI training
- **Palimpsest position:** Even transformative use requires consent (Clause 1.2)
- US fair use broader than UK fair dealing or Dutch citaatrecht

**Limitation:**
- US fair use doctrine not applicable in UK or Netherlands
- UK/Dutch law: no general transformative use exception
- Contractual restrictions (Palimpsest Clause 1.2) may prevent AI training even if transformative

---

### 5.2 TDM and Contractual Override

**No Binding UK/Netherlands Case Law Yet on AI Training and TDM Exceptions**

**Legislative Framework (Netherlands):**
- Auteurswet Art. 15i(3): Rightholder may opt out via machine-readable means
- **Palimpsest Clause 1.2 = contractual opt-out**
- Courts likely to enforce contractual restrictions (freedom of contract principle)

**UK Proposed Exception (s 29B) Not Implemented:**
- No commercial TDM exception yet
- Contractual restrictions likely enforceable under contract law
- Courts respect freedom of contract (subject to public policy)

---

## 6. Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Digital Evidence

### 6.1 Blockchain Evidence Admissibility

#### UK: *AA v Persons Unknown*
**Citation:** [2019] EWHC 3556 (Comm); [2020] 4 WLR 35
**Court:** High Court of England and Wales (Commercial Court)
**Judge:** Bryan J
**Date:** 20 December 2019

**Holding:**
> Cryptocurrency held in digital wallets is property. Blockchain records admissible as evidence.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- **Quantum-proof traceability:** Blockchain evidence recognised
- Cryptographic records can prove authorship and provenance
- Supports Palimpsest use of decentralised attribution systems

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [53-60]: Cryptocurrencies are property (novel, excludable, assignable)
- [142]: Blockchain records reliable evidence

---

#### UK: *Executors of Cummings v Danks*
**Citation:** [2020] EWHC 1273 (Comm)
**Court:** High Court (Commercial Court)
**Judge:** HHJ Pelling QC
**Date:** 20 May 2020

**Holding:**
> Smart contracts legally binding if ordinary contract requirements met (offer, acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations).

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- **Smart contract licensing:** Enforceable under English law
- Code as contractual terms
- Supports DAO governance and automated licensing mechanisms

---

### 6.2 Netherlands: Electronic Signatures and Evidence

**No Leading Case Law on Blockchain in Netherlands Copyright Context**

**Statutory Basis:**
- Burgerlijk Wetboek Art. 10:156a: Electronic data admissible as evidence
- Electronic Communications Act 2000 (applies via EU Directive 1999/93/EC)
- Dutch courts recognise electronic signatures and timestamping

**Academic Commentary:**
- M.H.M. Schellekens, "Smart Contracts and the Law" (2018)
- Blockchain evidence likely admissible; probative value assessed case-by-case

---

## 7. Damages and Remedies for Moral Rights Violations

### 7.1 Hypothetical Licence Fee (User Principle)

#### UK: *Phonographic Performance Ltd v Hagan*
**Citation:** [2016] EWHC 3076 (IPEC)
**Court:** Intellectual Property Enterprise Court
**Judge:** HHJ Hacon
**Date:** 1 December 2016

**Holding:**
> Damages for copyright infringement may be assessed as reasonable licence fee (user principle). Amount claimant would have charged for licence.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Quantifies damages for unauthorised use
- Supports Palimpsest enforcement: hypothetical licence fee if Clause 1.2 breached
- AI training without consent = unauthorised use → damages = reasonable fee for AI training licence

**Key Paragraphs:**
- [36-40]: User principle: claimant entitled to fee they would have charged
- [45]: Evidence of market rates relevant to assessment

---

### 7.2 Non-Pecuniary Damages (Moral Harm)

#### Scotland: *Solatium Principle*
**No Copyright-Specific Case; General Scots Delict Principle**

**Principle:**
- Scots law: *solatium* compensates non-pecuniary harm (injury to feelings, honour, reputation)
- Applicable to moral rights infringement (CDPA s 103)
- **Stronger basis for emotional lineage damages than England**

**Academic Commentary:**
- Hector L MacQueen, "Moral Rights and Scottish Law" (2007)
- Civilian tradition supports broader non-pecuniary damages

---

#### Netherlands: *Immateriële Schade* (Moral Damages)
**Statutory Basis:** Auteurswet Art. 27a (damages for infringement)

**Case Law:**
- Dutch courts award *immateriële schade* for injury to honour/reputation
- Moral rights violations = personality harm (compensable)
- **Supports Palimpsest emotional lineage damages**

**Example (not copyright-specific):**
- Lindenbaum/Cohen (HR 1919): Unlawful act causing non-pecuniary harm → damages
- Applied to copyright moral rights violations

---

## 8. Collective Authorship and Cultural Rights

### 8.1 Joint Authorship

#### UK: *Grierson v Grierson*
**Citation:** [1993] SC 259 (CSIH)
**Court:** Court of Session (Inner House, Scotland)
**Date:** 1993

**Holding:**
> Joint authorship requires collaboration and inseparable contributions. Each author must contribute creative skill and labour.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Collective authorship recognised if contributions inseparable
- **DAO authorship:** Multiple contributors may be joint authors
- Supports Palimpsest collective cultural ownership model

**Key Principle:**
- Joint authorship = collaboration + inseparable contributions
- Each author has equal rights unless agreed otherwise

---

### 8.2 Cultural Heritage and Collective Rights

**No UK/Netherlands Case Law Recognising Indigenous Collective Copyright**

**Comparative Reference (Australia):**
- *Milpurrurru v Indofurn Pty Ltd* [1994] FCA 1544 (Aus)
  - Aboriginal art copyright; cultural harm considered in damages
  - **Persuasive for Palimpsest emotional lineage concept**

**Palimpsest Position:**
- Contractual framework (DAO governance) fills gap
- Cultural harm recognised via non-pecuniary damages (Scotland/Netherlands)

---

## 9. Jurisdiction and Choice of Law

### 9.1 Contractual Choice of Law

#### Scotland: *Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co Ltd*
**Citation:** [1894] AC 535 (HL)
**Court:** House of Lords (applicable in Scotland)
**Date:** 1894

**Holding:**
> Restrictive covenants enforceable if reasonable in scope and duration. Public policy considerations apply.

**Relevance to Palimpsest:**
- Palimpsest Clause 1.2 (AI restriction) = restrictive covenant
- Must be reasonable: likely yes (limited to AI training, protects legitimate interest)
- Scottish courts likely to enforce

---

### 9.2 Recognition of Foreign Judgments

#### UK/Netherlands: Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (2005)
**Treaty:** Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (30 June 2005, entered into force 1 October 2015)

**UK and Netherlands Signatories**

**Principle:**
- Exclusive choice of court clauses respected internationally
- Judgments from chosen court automatically recognised in signatory states
- **Supports Palimpsest cross-border enforcement**

---

## 10. Summary: Case Law Support for Palimpsest Provisions

| **Palimpsest Clause** | **Supporting Case Law** | **Jurisdiction** | **Principle** |
|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **1.2 NI Systems Consent** | *Confetti Records* [2003]; *Google v Oracle* (persuasive) | UK; US | Unauthorised use in different context requires consent |
| **2.3 Metadata Preservation** | *Painer* [2011]; *Scientology* (NL) [2002] | CJEU; NL | Attribution and source indication mandatory |
| **Emotional Lineage (Integrity)** | *Endstra Tapes* (NL) [2001]; *Eyeworks* (NL) [2010] | NL | Context and author's vision protected |
| **Attribution** | *Sawkins* [2005]; *Scientology* (NL) [2002] | UK; NL | Author must be identified; source indication required |
| **Quantum-Proof Traceability** | *AA v Persons Unknown* [2019]; *Executors of Cummings* [2020] | UK | Blockchain evidence admissible; smart contracts enforceable |
| **DAO Governance** | *Grierson* (Sc) [1993]; *Executors of Cummings* [2020] | Scotland; UK | Joint authorship; smart contracts legally binding |
| **Damages (Economic)** | *Phonographic Performance* [2016]; *Meltwater* [2011] | UK | Hypothetical licence fee (user principle) |
| **Damages (Moral)** | *Endstra Tapes* (NL) [2001]; Scots solatium principle | NL; Scotland | Non-pecuniary harm compensable |

---

## 11. Gaps in Case Law

### 11.1 No Binding Precedent on:
- AI training as copyright infringement (UK/Netherlands)
- TDM exception contractual override (Art. 15i(3) Aw untested)
- Emotional lineage as distinct from statutory moral rights
- DAO legal personality in copyright context
- Quantum computing and cryptographic attribution

### 11.2 Emerging Areas (Watch for Developments):
- **AI-generated works authorship:** Courts will clarify human authorship threshold
- **TDM opt-out enforcement:** First cases testing Art. 15i(3) (Netherlands) and proposed s 29B (UK)
- **Smart contract disputes:** Increasing case law on blockchain and digital contracts
- **NFTs and provenance:** Rights management for digital assets

---

## 12. Conclusion

Existing case law provides **substantial support** for Palimpsest License principles:

1. **Moral rights:** Strong protection in Netherlands and Scotland (civilian traditions)
2. **Attribution:** Mandatory in quotation, required for moral rights
3. **Integrity:** Contextual modifications violate moral rights (Dutch courts especially protective)
4. **Metadata:** Rights management information protected (UK s 296ZG, NL Art. 29a)
5. **Contractual restrictions:** Enforceable under contract law (freedom of contract)
6. **Digital evidence:** Blockchain and smart contracts recognised (UK leading cases)

**Primary Jurisdictional Advantage: Netherlands**
- Strongest moral rights case law (*Endstra*, *Eyeworks*)
- Personality rights tradition supports emotional lineage
- TDM opt-out statutory basis (Art. 15i(3))

**Secondary Advantage: Scotland**
- Civilian affinity (solatium for moral harm)
- Legal personality for associations (DAO governance)
- Cultural resonance (diaspora narratives)
