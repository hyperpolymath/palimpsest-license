# Creative Commons Global Summit Session Proposal

## Session Title
**Beyond BY-SA: Evolving Open Licensing for the AI Training Era**

## Session Format
**Panel Discussion and Workshop** (90 minutes)

## Abstract
Creative Commons licenses revolutionised open culture but predate generative AI, large-scale web scraping, and the commodification of creative labour by billion-dollar AI systems. The Palimpsest License framework extends open licensing principles—attribution, share-alike, consent—to address AI-specific challenges: metadata preservation through transformation chains, consent signalling for interpretive vs. non-interpretive AI systems, and emotional lineage protection. This session explores how the open licensing movement can evolve to protect creators whilst maintaining commitment to cultural commons, examining complementarity between CC licenses and AI-era innovations, and developing community consensus on future directions for open licensing.

## Problem Statement

### The AI Challenge for Open Licensing
**Creative Commons licenses face unprecedented challenges:**
1. **Attribution failure**: CC-BY works scraped for AI training with no practical attribution in outputs
2. **Share-Alike circumvention**: AI-generated derivatives don't carry forward CC-SA obligations
3. **Commercial exploitation**: CC-NC violated by billion-dollar AI companies
4. **Metadata stripping**: License information removed in training data pipelines
5. **Consent ambiguity**: Existing licenses don't distinguish interpretive vs. non-interpretive AI use

### The Open Culture Dilemma
The open licensing movement faces tension between core values:
- **Access and sharing** vs. **creator protection from exploitation**
- **Openness and interoperability** vs. **meaningful consent and attribution**
- **Simple, universal licenses** vs. **nuanced, context-sensitive permissions**
- **Legal enforceability** vs. **symbolic and cultural significance**
- **Individual creator rights** vs. **cultural commons and collective heritage**

### Why This Matters to CC Community
- Erosion of trust in open licensing if creators feel exploited
- Need to adapt to technological change whilst preserving principles
- Opportunity to lead on ethical AI and creator protection
- Risk of fragmentation if community doesn't address AI challenges
- Alignment with CC's mission of maximising digital creativity, sharing, and innovation

## Goals and Expected Outcomes

### Primary Goals
1. **Explore complementarity** between CC licenses and AI-era licensing innovations
2. **Gather community feedback** on extending CC for AI contexts
3. **Identify opportunities** for CC to lead on ethical AI licensing standards
4. **Build consensus** on principles for AI-era open licensing
5. **Foster collaboration** between CC, Palimpsest, and other licensing initiatives

### Expected Outcomes
- Community statement on AI and open licensing
- Roadmap for potential CC license updates or extensions
- Collaboration framework between licensing initiatives
- Technical standards proposals for metadata preservation
- Action plan for CC leadership on AI ethics

## Complementarity Analysis: CC and Palimpsest

### Shared Principles
- **Attribution**: Both require credit to creators
- **Share-Alike**: Both support copyleft and commons-building
- **Openness**: Both enable reuse and cultural participation
- **Machine-readability**: Both use structured metadata
- **Global applicability**: Both designed for international use

### Palimpsest Extensions
- **Layered consent**: Distinguishes interpretive vs. non-interpretive AI
- **Emotional lineage**: Protects narrative context and cultural significance
- **Quantum-proof traceability**: Future-proofs attribution mechanisms
- **DAO governance**: Enables collective rights management
- **Trauma-informed**: Specific protections for sensitive narratives

### Coexistence Model
- **Palimpsest + CC**: Works can be dual-licensed (e.g., CC-BY-SA + Palimpsest)
- **Palimpsest extends CC**: Additional protections on top of CC baseline
- **CC DAO integration**: CC licenses + DAO governance for collectives
- **Metadata interoperability**: Palimpsest metadata compatible with CC REL

## Discussion Prompts

### For Technical Breakout Group
1. What metadata standards could preserve attribution through AI training and inference?
2. How can license information be embedded in AI model outputs?
3. What DNS or HTTP mechanisms could enable automated license discovery?
4. How do we balance comprehensive metadata with privacy and simplicity?

### For Consent/Permission Breakout Group
1. Should CC licenses be extended to explicitly address AI training?
2. How granular should permission layers be? (Training, inference, distribution, etc.)
3. Opt-in vs. opt-out: What default serves creators and commons best?
4. Can interpretive/non-interpretive distinction be clearly defined?

### For Commons/Collective Rights Breakout Group
1. How does share-alike apply to AI-generated derivatives?
2. Should public domain works be protected from commercial AI exploitation?
3. What governance models support collective licensing (e.g., communities, not just individuals)?
4. How do we prevent "tragedy of the commons" whilst maintaining openness?

### For Cultural/Ethical Breakout Group
1. What cultural contexts are inadequately served by current CC licenses?
2. How can licensing frameworks center indigenous knowledge and community ownership?
3. What's the role of "emotional lineage" beyond legal attribution?
4. How do we decolonise open licensing and address power asymmetries?

## CC Community Considerations

### CC's Values and Mission
- **Universal access** to research, education, and culture
- **Openness and sharing** as foundational principles
- **Maximising creativity** through legal certainty and simple tools
- **Interoperability** and avoiding fragmentation
- **Global community** and decentralised governance

### Potential Concerns
- **Complexity**: Additional license layers may confuse adopters
- **Fragmentation**: Risk of incompatible licensing proliferation
- **Mission drift**: Overemphasising restriction vs. openness
- **Enforcement**: Can nuanced licenses be practically enforced?
- **Community division**: Debates over direction may create conflict

### Opportunities for CC Leadership
- **Set standards** for ethical AI licensing
- **Convene community** for collaborative solution-finding
- **Develop CC extensions** that address AI whilst preserving simplicity
- **Advocate for platforms** to respect CC intent in AI contexts
- **Research and education** on AI impacts on open culture

## Success Criteria
