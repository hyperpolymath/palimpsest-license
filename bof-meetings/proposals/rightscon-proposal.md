# RightsCon Session Proposal: Palimpsest License Framework

## Session Title
**From Extraction to Consent: Protecting Marginalised Creators' Rights in the AI Training Era**

## Session Format
**Interactive Discussion** (90 minutes)

## Abstract
AI systems built on massive web scraping extract creative labour from the most vulnerable: diaspora storytellers, trauma survivors, indigenous knowledge keepers, protest artists, and marginalised communities whose narratives fuel billion-dollar AI models without consent or compensation. This session examines the Palimpsest License framework—a rights-based approach to creative attribution designed to protect emotional lineage, cultural context, and symbolic significance. We centre voices from marginalised creator communities to develop advocacy strategies, technical safeguards, and governance mechanisms that shift power from extractive AI corporations to those whose stories and struggles are being commodified.

## Problem Statement

### The Human Rights Crisis
**AI training as cultural extraction:**
1. **Diaspora narratives** are scraped from personal blogs, translated without consent, stripped of cultural context
2. **Trauma testimony** from survivors becomes training data for chatbots that trivialise suffering
3. **Protest art** and resistance imagery train surveillance systems used against activists
4. **Indigenous knowledge** is extracted, decontextualised, and sold back without attribution
5. **Marginalised language communities** lose control over linguistic and cultural heritage

### Power Asymmetries
- **Global North corporations** extract value from Global South creators
- **Tech platforms** claim ownership over community-generated content
- **AI systems** perpetuate bias whilst erasing authorship of marginalised voices
- **Legal systems** favour capital over creators, especially those without resources for litigation
- **Existing licenses** (Creative Commons, etc.) designed for different era, fail to address AI-specific harms

### Rights at Stake
- **Cultural rights** (UDHR Article 27, ICESCR Article 15)
- **Freedom of expression** (ICCPR Article 19)
- **Right to privacy and dignity** (UDHR Articles 12, 22)
- **Indigenous peoples' rights** (UNDRIP Articles 11, 31)
- **Economic justice and fair compensation** (ICESCR Article 7)
- **Protection from exploitation** (ICCPR Article 8)

### Why RightsCon?
This is fundamentally a **human rights issue** requiring:
- Centering marginalised voices in technical design
- Challenging corporate power and extractive systems
- Building solidarity across creator communities
- Developing advocacy strategies for systemic change
- Connecting digital rights to economic and cultural justice

## Goals and Expected Outcomes

### Primary Goals
1. **Centre marginalised creator voices** in discussions of AI ethics and creative rights
2. **Develop advocacy strategies** for protecting vulnerable communities from AI extraction
3. **Build solidarity** across diaspora, indigenous, survivor, and activist creator communities
4. **Challenge power structures** that enable corporate AI extraction
5. **Create actionable framework** for rights-based creative attribution

### Expected Outcomes
- Statement of principles from marginalised creator communities
- Advocacy toolkit for challenging AI extraction
- Coalition of organisations committed to creator justice
- Concrete demands for AI companies and platforms
- Roadmap for rights-based technical standards
