= Contractiles - Build Automation
:toc:

Build automation and task runner configuration files.

== What are Contractiles?

**Contractiles** are build automation files that define project tasks, validation rules, and operational contracts. The name reflects their role as "contracts" between developers and the build system.

== Files

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| File | Status | Purpose

| `Justfile`
| ✅ Present
| Primary task runner using [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

| `Mustfile`
| ✅ Present
| Must-have validation rules and checks

| `Lustfile`
| 🔜 Planned
| Desired optimizations and enhancements

| `Dustfile`
| 🔜 Planned
| Cleanup automation and artifact removal

| `Trustfile`
| 🔜 Planned
| Security verification and trust checks
|===

== Justfile Usage

The `Justfile` provides common development tasks:

[source,bash]
----
# List all available tasks
just --list

# Build Rust tools
just build

# Run tests
just test

# Format code
just fmt

# Run all checks
just check

# Validate license compliance
just validate
----

**Note**: You need [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed:

[source,bash]
----
# Install just
cargo install just

# Or via package manager
# Fedora: dnf install just
# Ubuntu: apt install just
# macOS: brew install just
----

== Mustfile

The `Mustfile` defines validation rules that **must** pass before:

* Committing code
* Creating releases
* Merging pull requests

Rules include:

* License header presence (SPDX)
* File format validation
* Directory structure checks
* Metadata consistency

== Future Contractiles

=== Lustfile (Planned)

Defines **desired but optional** optimizations:

* Performance improvements
* Code quality enhancements
* Documentation completeness
* Test coverage goals

These are "nice to have" - they improve quality but aren't blockers.

=== Dustfile (Planned)

Cleanup automation:

* Remove build artifacts
* Clean temporary files
* Prune old branches
* Archive outdated materials

=== Trustfile (Planned)

Security and trust verification:

* Signature verification
* Dependency auditing
* SBOM generation
* Supply chain security checks

== Why a Separate Directory?

Contractiles are grouped in `contractiles/` to:

1. **Reduce root clutter** - Build files separate from content
2. **Clear purpose** - All automation in one place
3. **Easy discovery** - AI agents know where to look
4. **Consistent pattern** - Follows Hyperpolymath standards

== Integration

Contractiles integrate with:

* **Git hooks** (`.githooks/`) - Pre-commit/pre-push validation
* **CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/`) - Automated testing
* **SCM files** (`.machine_readable/`) - Metadata consistency
