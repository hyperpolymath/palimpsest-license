Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Palimpsest‑MPL License ecosystem.  
This project is stewarded by hyperpolymath and the Palimpsest Stewardship Council, and contributions of all kinds — legal, technical, narrative, or conceptual — are welcome.

== Before You Begin

The Palimpsest License is both a legal artefact and a cultural one.  
Contributions should respect the project’s core principles:

* ethical use  
* emotional lineage  
* provenance integrity  
* narrative clarity  
* reversibility and auditability  

If you’re unsure whether your idea fits, open an issue — discussion is part of the process.

== Getting Started

. Fork the repository.
. Create a feature branch from `main`.
. Make your changes in small, focused commits.
. Run the test suite:
+
----
just test
----
. Ensure documentation builds cleanly.
. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your change.

Maintainers will review your contribution and may request revisions.

== Repository Structure

├── docs/           # User guides, integration docs, FAQ

└── *.adoc          # Governance, versioning, contributing, maintainers

If your contribution touches multiple areas, please describe the relationships clearly in your PR.

== Commit Guidelines

=== Conventional Commits

Use the conventional commit format:

----
type(scope): short description
----

Examples:

* `fix(tools): correct signature verification error`
* `docs(legal): update Exhibit A wording`
* `feat(audit): add SPDX header checker`

Common types:

* `feat` – new functionality  
* `fix` – bug fix  
* `docs` – documentation changes  
* `refactor` – structural improvements  
* `chore` – maintenance tasks  
* `test` – adding or updating tests  

=== Commit Signing

If you have a GPG key, please sign your commits.  
This supports provenance integrity and aligns with the project’s ethical commitments.

=== Atomicity

Each commit should represent a single conceptual change.  
Avoid mixing unrelated updates.

== Adding SPDX Headers

All source files must include SPDX identifiers.

Example for code:

----
// SPDX-License-Identifier: PMPL-1.0-or-later
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2025 Your Name mailto:email@example.com (example.com in Bing)
----

Example for documentation:

----
SPDX-License-Identifier: PMPL-1.0-or-later
SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2025 Your Name <email@example.com>
----

This ensures traceability and legal clarity across the ecosystem.

== Building and Testing

The project uses a `Justfile` for common tasks.

=== Build all tools

----
just build
----

=== Run tests

----
just test
----

=== Validate compliance

----
just validate
----

This includes:

* SPDX header checks  
* SCM manifest validation  
* AsciiDoc build checks  
* provenance audit (if tools are present)

== Making Changes to the License Text

Changes to:

* `legal/PALIMPSEST-MPL-1.0.txt`
* any exhibit
* governance or versioning documents

require review and approval by the **Palimpsest Stewardship Council**.

See:

* `GOVERNANCE.adoc`
* `VERSIONING.adoc`
* `MAINTAINERS.adoc`

for details on the process.

== Documentation Contributions

Documentation is written in AsciiDoc.  
Please follow the existing style:

* clear section headings  
* short paragraphs  
* code blocks for commands  
* tables for structured information  
* narrative clarity and ethical framing  

If adding new docs, update the table of contents in `README.adoc` if appropriate.

== Filing Issues

Use GitHub Issues for:

* bug reports  
* documentation gaps  
* feature requests  
* questions about interpretation  
* proposals for new exhibits or tooling  

Please include:

* steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
* expected vs actual behaviour  
* relevant files or sections  
* context for legal or ethical concerns  

== Getting Help

* Open an issue for specific questions.  
* Use GitHub Discussions for broader topics.  
* See the FAQ under `docs/`.  
* Contact maintainers for sensitive matters (security, legal exposure).  

== License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions are licensed under:

----
SPDX-License-Identifier: PMPL-1.0-or-later
----

This ensures consistency with the project’s legal and ethical framework.

== Thank You

Your contributions help sustain a license built not only from law, but from care —  
a framework for creators navigating a world shared by humans and algorithms.
