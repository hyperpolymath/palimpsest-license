This file defines who maintains the Palimpsest‑MPL License repository, how stewardship works in practice, and how to reach the right humans (or teams) for different kinds of changes.

toc::[]

== Roles and Responsibilities

=== Palimpsest Stewardship Council

The *Palimpsest Stewardship Council* is the ultimate steward of:

* the Palimpsest‑MPL License text and exhibits
* the ethical and provenance principles it encodes
* the version lineage (PMPL‑1.0‑or‑later and successors)
* interpretive guidance and dispute mediation

See `GOVERNANCE.adoc` and `VERSIONING.adoc` for formal processes.

The Council is responsible for:

* approving changes to the license text and exhibits
* issuing clarifications and interpretive notes
* approving new major and minor versions
* ensuring alignment with Dutch law and other key jurisdictions

== Maintainer Structure

The repository is maintained in layers:

* *Core Maintainer* – has broad commit rights across the repo; curates overall structure and direction.
* *Domain Maintainers* – own specific areas (legal text, tools, docs, SCM manifests).
* *Stewardship Council* – reviews and ratifies changes that affect the license itself or its core governance.

== Current Maintainers

[NOTE]
Update this section as maintainers change.

=== Core Maintainer

* *Core Repository Steward*  
  Responsible for overall repo health, structure, and coherence.  
  Coordinates between legal, technical, and governance changes.

=== Domain Maintainers

* *License & Legal Artefacts*  
  Scope: `legal/`, `legal/exhibits/`, `legal/historical/`, jurisdictional frameworks, legal strategy docs.  
  Responsibilities:
  * keep the canonical PMPL text and exhibits in sync with Council decisions
  * ensure legal resources are consistent with the published license
  * coordinate with external legal reviewers and counsel

* *Governance & Policy*  
  Scope: `GOVERNANCE.adoc`, `VERSIONING.adoc`, `CODE_OF_PRACTICE.*`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODEOWNERS`.  
  Responsibilities:
  * maintain governance and versioning documentation
  * keep security, conduct, and contribution policies current
  * align repo practices with Council decisions and Scorecard best practices

* *Tooling & Provenance*  
  Scope: `tools/pmpl-sign`, `tools/pmpl-verify`, `tools/pmpl-audit`, CI workflows under `.github/workflows/`.  
  Responsibilities:
  * keep Rust tools building and tested
  * maintain provenance and audit tooling
  * ensure CI/CD reflects least‑privilege and provenance‑aware practices

* *Documentation & Onboarding*  
  Scope: `README.adoc`, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.adoc`, onboarding guides.  
  Responsibilities:
  * maintain user‑facing documentation
  * ensure docs reflect current PMPL semantics and ecosystem practices
  * keep changelog accurate and narrative‑friendly

* *SCM Manifests & Agentic Interfaces*  
  Scope: `ECOSYSTEM.scm`, `META.scm`, `PLAYBOOK.scm`, `AGENTIC.scm`, `NEUROSYM.scm`.  
  Responsibilities:
  * keep SCM manifests consistent with actual repo state
  * evolve agentic and neurosymbolic interfaces as the ecosystem grows
  * ensure manifests remain reversible, auditable, and narratable

== How to Contact Maintainers

For most contributions:

. Open an issue in the repository.
. Tag the relevant area (e.g. *license*, *governance*, *tools*, *docs*).
. Describe:
   * what you want to change
   * why it matters
   * which files or domains are affected

For sensitive issues (security, legal exposure, ethical misuse):

* Follow the process in `SECURITY.md` (for security vulnerabilities).
* Or contact the Palimpsest Stewardship Council via the channels listed in `README.adoc`.

== How Decisions Are Made

* *Routine maintenance* (typos, minor docs, small tooling fixes):  
  May be approved by a relevant Domain Maintainer.

* *Substantive changes* to:
  * license text
  * exhibits
  * governance
  * versioning rules

  require review and approval by the Palimpsest Stewardship Council, following the processes in `GOVERNANCE.adoc` and `VERSIONING.adoc`.

== Becoming a Maintainer

The Council may invite contributors to become Maintainers when they:

* demonstrate sustained, thoughtful contributions
* show alignment with PMPL’s ethical and provenance principles
* engage constructively with the community and Council

New maintainers are usually:

* onboarded as Domain Maintainers for a specific area
* later considered for broader responsibilities if appropriate

Status and scope of maintainers are recorded and updated in this file.
