== What is PMPL?

The Palimpsest-MPL License extends the proven Mozilla Public License 2.0 with three key additions:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Feature | Description

| **🌍 Ethical Use Guidelines (Exhibit A)**
| A structured framework for responsible use, including cultural sensitivity, community obligations, and narrative respect.

| **🔐 Quantum-Safe Provenance (Exhibit B)**
| Optional post-quantum cryptographic signatures for long-term attribution and lineage integrity.

| **💭 Emotional Lineage Protection**
| Recognition that creative works carry cultural, symbolic, and narrative meaning beyond mere code or text.
|===

=== Designed For

* ✅ Open-source software
* ✅ Creative works and art
* ✅ Research artifacts and papers
* ✅ Datasets and training corpora
* ✅ Machine learning models
* ✅ Provenance-sensitive cultural materials

=== AI Training: **Permitted with Attribution**

PMPL explicitly permits use in AI training datasets, with clear attribution obligations for non-interpretive systems.

== Why PMPL?

[quote]
____
Like a palimpsest manuscript where each layer builds upon what came before, this license recognizes that creative works carry history, context, and meaning that transcend mere code or text.
____

Traditional licenses focus only on copyright and patents. PMPL adds:

* **Cultural context** - Honor the narrative and symbolic weight of works
* **Attribution chains** - Cryptographic provenance for long-term lineage
* **Ethical framework** - Structured guidance beyond "don't be evil"
* **Future-proof crypto** - Post-quantum signatures protect attribution for decades
