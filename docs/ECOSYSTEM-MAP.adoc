== Overview

The Palimpsest ecosystem consists of four interlocking layers:

. **Legal Layer** (`legal/`)  
   Defines rights, obligations, exhibits, and jurisdictional frameworks.

. **Governance Layer** (`governance/`)  
   Defines processes, decision‑making, versioning, and community standards.

. **Specification Layer** (`spec/`)  
   Defines normative technical and provenance specifications.

. **Documentation Layer** (`docs/`)  
   Provides conceptual, narrative, and onboarding materials.

== Flow of Authority

Legal → Governance → Specifications → Documentation

== Flow of Understanding

Documentation → Specifications → Governance → Legal

== Provenance Flow

* Legal artefacts reference specifications  
* Specifications reference governance rules  
* Governance rules reference legal foundations  
* Documentation explains all three
