= Cross‑Link Audit Procedure

This document describes the procedure for auditing cross‑links across the Palimpsest‑MPL repository.

== Purpose

Cross‑link audits ensure:

* no broken references  
* no outdated paths  
* no orphaned exhibits  
* no circular dependencies  
* consistent AsciiDoc linking patterns  

== Procedure

. Identify all `.adoc` and `.md` files.
. Extract all `xref:` and `link:` references.
. Verify that each referenced file exists.
. Confirm that renamed or migrated files have updated links.
. Check that governance, legal, and spec links follow canonical paths.
. Flag any links pointing to deprecated or historical artefacts.
. Produce a summary report for maintainers.

== Review Frequency

* Monthly for active development  
* Before each tagged release  
* After any directory restructuring  

== Governance

Cross‑link audits are part of the Maintainer Review Checklist.
