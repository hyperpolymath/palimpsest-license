# Palimpsest License — Deep Dive into the Ethical Framework

## Introduction: Ethics Beyond Law

The Palimpsest License is fundamentally an **ethical license**. While it has legal enforceability, its primary purpose is to embed moral principles into the infrastructure of creative work licensing. This document explores the philosophical foundations, practical applications, and ethical edge cases of the Palimpsest framework.

> "This is a license born not just from copyright, but from care. From narrative debt. From cultural refusal. From emotional fidelity."

Traditional copyright protects **expression**. The Palimpsest License protects **meaning**.

## Core Ethical Principles

The Palimpsest License rests on five foundational ethical principles:

### 1. Meaning Has Value Beyond Market

Creative works carry **emotional, cultural, and narrative weight** that cannot be reduced to commercial value. A protest song written in prison is not just "content" — it's a vessel for resistance, grief, and hope. The Palimpsest License asserts that this meaning deserves protection.

**Ethical implication**: Users must engage with works as **cultural artefacts**, not just extractable content.

**Example**: A song about displacement carries the weight of actual human displacement. Stripping that context to use the melody in a jingle is not just a copyright violation — it's an ethical betrayal.

### 2. Attribution Is a Form of Care

Traditional attribution ("Written by Jane Doe") treats credit as a legal formality. Palimpsest views attribution as an **act of care** — acknowledging not just authorship, but the web of influences, communities, and emotional labour that made the work possible.

**Ethical implication**: Attribution should honour **emotional lineage** and **cultural roots**, not just legal ownership.

**Example**: Instead of "Song by John Smith," try:
```
Song by John Smith
Drawing from Irish folk traditions
Honouring the unnamed singers whose voices echo in this work
Written in response to [historical context]
```

### 3. Context Shapes Meaning

The same words, images, or sounds mean different things in different contexts. A symbol sacred to one community becomes offensive when used decoratively by another. The Palimpsest License recognises that **context is content**.

**Ethical implication**: Preserving cultural and emotional context is not optional — it's integral to the work itself.

**Example**: A traditional healing song cannot be ethically used in a commercial spa without acknowledging its cultural origins, obtaining community consent, and ensuring the use doesn't trivialise or exploit.

### 4. AI Amplifies Ethical Risks

AI systems can strip context, erase lineage, and commodify meaning at unprecedented scale. What would take decades of human cultural appropriation can happen in seconds with generative AI. The Palimpsest License requires **explicit consent for interpretive AI** to ensure creators control how their work trains systems that shape culture.

**Ethical implication**: AI training is not a neutral technical process — it's a form of cultural sampling that requires consent.

**Example**: Training an LLM on diaspora poetry without consent doesn't just violate copyright — it enables the AI to generate "diaspora-style" poetry that erases the actual diaspora voices, flooding the market with synthetic substitutes.

### 5. Creators Deserve to Say "No"

Open culture celebrates sharing, but ethical sharing requires **consent**. The Palimpsest License empowers creators to set boundaries around how their work is used, especially when it carries trauma, cultural significance, or emotional vulnerability.

**Ethical implication**: "Open" doesn't mean "free-for-all." Respect for creator boundaries is fundamental.

**Example**: A survivor's memoir about abuse can be shared under Palimpsest with AI training prohibited, ensuring their story isn't used to generate fictional abuse narratives without their knowledge or consent.

---

## Symbolic Credit Beyond Attribution

### What Is Symbolic Credit?

**Symbolic credit** acknowledges the **emotional, cultural, or thematic lineage** of a work, even when direct authorship is unclear or collective.

Traditional credit: "Based on a folk tale"
Symbolic credit: "Based on oral traditions of the Yoruba diaspora, passed down through generations of unnamed storytellers, preserving cultural memory through colonial displacement"

### Why It Matters

Marginalised communities often create collectively. Indigenous knowledge, folk traditions, oral histories — these don't have single "authors" but emerge from communities over time. Symbolic credit honours this reality rather than forcing it into Western individualist frameworks.

**Ethical principle**: When a work draws from collective cultural heritage, credit the **community**, not just the individual transcriber or adapter.

### How to Implement

1. **Identify lineage**: What cultural traditions does this work draw from?
2. **Name communities**: Be specific (not "tribal music" but "Sami joik traditions")
3. **Acknowledge collective authorship**: "While I am the legal author, this work belongs to..."
4. **Credit the chain**: If you're adapting someone else's adaptation, credit both

**Example**:
```
"River Song" by Maria Garcia
Drawing from Quechua water blessing traditions
As taught by elders of the Andean highlands
Adapted with community consent
Honouring the generations who preserved these songs through suppression
```

### Symbolic Credit in Different Media

**Literature**:
- Acknowledge oral tradition sources
- Credit storytelling traditions
- Honour cultural narrative structures

**Music**:
- Credit musical traditions (not just individual artists)
- Acknowledge ritual or ceremonial origins
- Preserve cultural context of instruments or scales

**Visual Art**:
- Credit cultural artistic traditions
- Acknowledge symbolic systems
- Honour sacred or ceremonial uses

**Film/Video**:
- Credit community stories and experiences
- Acknowledge collective memory
- Preserve emotional and historical context

## Remixing Grief with Care

### The Ethics of Trauma Narratives

Works that deal with **trauma, loss, or collective grief** require special ethical consideration. These aren't just "content" — they're vessels for processing pain, honouring loss, and preserving difficult truths.

**Core principle**: Never reduce pain to data points or aesthetic elements.

### Ethical Requirements for Remixing Trauma

1. **Contextual Honesty**: Acknowledge the original pain without romanticising it
2. **Community Consent**: Engage with affected communities when reworking collective trauma
3. **Emotional Boundaries**: Never profit from unconsented exploitation of personal suffering
4. **Preservation of Weight**: Maintain the emotional gravity; don't "lighten" for marketability

### Case Study: Protest Songs

A protest song written during political imprisonment carries:
- **Historical weight**: Documenting specific oppression
- **Emotional lineage**: Expressing collective resistance
- **Cultural significance**: Belonging to a movement, not just an individual
- **Symbolic power**: Each performance is an act of continued resistance

**Ethical remix**:
- Preserves original context (why it was written, under what conditions)
- Credits the movement, not just the songwriter
- Doesn't dilute the political message for commercial appeal
- Performs with awareness of ongoing struggles

**Unethical remix**:
- Strips political context to make it a generic "uplifting song"
- Uses the melody in advertising
- Claims the song is "universal" (erasing specific oppression)
- Profits without supporting the movement it came from

### Grief as Intellectual Property

Can grief be "owned"? The Palimpsest License argues that while **specific expressions** of grief can be copyrighted, the **emotional truth** belongs to the communities and individuals who experienced it.

**Ethical guideline**: If you didn't experience the grief, you can't claim it as generic material. You must acknowledge whose grief you're representing.

**Example**: A documentary about a genocide cannot ethically use survivor testimonies without:
- Explicit consent from survivors (or families if deceased)
- Preserving full names and context (unless anonymity requested)
- Revenue sharing or community support
- Ongoing relationship with the community, not extractive one-time use

### Remixing Without Exploitation

**Permitted remixing**:
- Adding your own grief in dialogue with the original
- Translating for accessibility while preserving weight
- Creating educational materials that honour the original
- Building upon with community blessing

**Prohibited remixing**:
- Commodifying pain for entertainment
- Stripping trauma to "make it more palatable"
- Using someone else's suffering as aesthetic backdrop
- Claiming universal ownership of specific pain

---

## Ambient Attribution for Immersive Works

### What Is Ambient Attribution?

**Ambient attribution** integrates credit **into the work itself**, rather than as a separate, easily-stripped statement. It's about **embedding recognition** in the design, structure, or environment of the work.

**Traditional attribution**: Credits at the end of a film (easily skipped)
**Ambient attribution**: Credits woven into the visual fabric of the film (part of the experience)

### Why It Matters

In immersive, interactive, or synthetic environments, traditional end-credits don't work. Users may never reach the "end." Attribution needs to be **discoverable, persistent, and integrated**.

**Ethical principle**: Attribution should match the medium and be impossible to accidentally lose.

### Examples by Medium

**Games**:
- Credits discoverable as in-game lore
- NPC dialogue references creators
- Environmental storytelling includes attribution
- Achievements unlock creator acknowledgments

**VR Experiences**:
- Spatial audio credits (whispered names in specific locations)
- Visual attribution as part of the environment (names in architecture)
- Metadata accessible through gesture or gaze
- Credits as explorable space

**Interactive Installations**:
- Physical plaques integrated into artwork
- QR codes linking to full cultural context
- Audio guides narrating lineage
- Visitor interaction reveals attribution layers

**Generative/AI Art**:
- Metadata embedded in every generated output
- Watermarks (visible or invisible) with creator info
- Blockchain registration linking to source
- Attribution in file properties

**Music/Audio**:
- Liner notes as part of album artwork (not separate)
- Audio signatures (subtle sound design acknowledging influences)
- Metadata in every file format
- Embedded cultural context in streaming descriptions

### Implementing Ambient Attribution

**Step 1**: Identify natural attribution points in your medium
- Where do users naturally look/listen/interact?
- What's integrated vs. easily skipped?

**Step 2**: Design attribution as feature, not afterthought
- Make it aesthetically appropriate
- Integrate it into user experience
- Don't make it intrusive, but don't hide it

**Step 3**: Test for discoverability
- Can new users find attribution without instructions?
- Does it survive format conversions?
- Is it accessible (screen readers, translations, etc.)?

**Step 4**: Layer attribution
- Basic: Creator name visible
- Intermediate: Cultural context discoverable
- Deep: Full lineage accessible for those who seek it

## Narrative Ethics in Synthetic Creation

### AI-Generated Content and Emotional Truth

When AI generates creative works, whose emotional truth does it represent? The AI has no emotions. It's remixing patterns from human creators. The Palimpsest License asserts that **AI outputs inherit ethical obligations from their training sources**.

**Core principle**: AI-generated content is derivative work, even when it doesn't directly copy.

### Ethical Requirements for AI Creation

1. **Source Transparency**: Disclose what training data was used
2. **Cultural Integrity**: Prevent algorithmic erasure of cultural context
3. **Human Oversight**: Ensure creative decisions remain human-led
4. **Attribution Mechanism**: Every AI output should be traceable to human sources

### Case Study: AI-Generated Poetry

An LLM trained on contemporary poetry generates new poems. Ethically:

**Required**:
- Disclosure: "Generated by GPT-4 trained on contemporary poetry corpus"
- Attribution: Link to training data sources (with permission)
- Cultural preservation: If training data had cultural context, preserve it in metadata
- Human curation: Human decides what to publish, not just automated generation

**Prohibited**:
- Claiming AI poems as wholly original
- Stripping metadata from AI-generated works
- Using protected works in training without consent
- Flooding market with AI works that economically undercut human poets

### The Problem of "Synthetic Diaspora"

If an AI is trained on diaspora narratives and generates "new" diaspora stories, is this:
- A) Amplifying diaspora voices?
- B) Appropriating and diluting diaspora experiences?

**Palimpsest position**: Without consent from the original diaspora creators, and without attribution/revenue sharing, this is appropriation. The AI is not experiencing diaspora — it's pattern-matching from those who did.

**Ethical use**:
- Train only on consented works
- Attribute AI outputs to human training sources
- Share revenue with original creators
- Position AI as tool to amplify, not replace, diaspora voices
- Maintain human diaspora voices as primary; AI as supplementary

---

## AI Training Ethics

### The Core Question

Is training an AI on creative works:
- A) Reading (permissible without consent)?
- B) Derivative work creation (requires permission)?
- C) Cultural sampling (requires community consent)?

**Palimpsest answer**: **B and C**. AI training creates derivative statistical models and, when cultural works are involved, constitutes cultural sampling.

### Interpretive vs. Non-Interpretive AI

**Non-Interpretive AI** (generally ethical without additional consent):
- Translation (preserves meaning in new language)
- Accessibility (text-to-speech, image descriptions)
- Search/indexing (helps find content)
- Format conversion (preserves content in new format)

**Key characteristic**: Doesn't create new meaning or remix cultural patterns.

**Interpretive AI** (requires explicit consent):
- Large Language Models (generate new text)
- Generative image AI (create new images)
- Music generation (compose new music)
- Style transfer (remix aesthetic patterns)

**Key characteristic**: Creates new works by learning and remixing patterns from training data.

### Why Consent Matters

**Without consent requirement**:
- Tech companies scrape all public creative works
- Creators have no say in how their work trains AI
- AI floods market with synthetic works, undercutting creators economically
- Cultural context gets lost in algorithmic averaging
- Marginalised voices get sampled without attribution or compensation

**With consent requirement**:
- Creators control whether their work trains AI
- Creates market for training data (economic fairness)
- Encourages AI developers to build attribution mechanisms
- Preserves cultural context through metadata requirements
- Centres creator agency

### Ethical AI Training Framework

**Step 1: Check Permissions**
- Review `.palimpsest.json` for `permissions.interpretiveAI`
- If false, do not include in training data
- If true, verify any additional requirements

**Step 2: Obtain Consent**
- Contact creator with specific use case
- Explain: What AI? What purpose? How attribution will work?
- Negotiate terms (licensing fee, attribution requirements, etc.)
- Get written consent

**Step 3: Preserve Metadata**
- Store full Palimpsest metadata alongside training data
- Link generated outputs to source works
- Maintain cultural context through training pipeline

**Step 4: Attribution in Outputs**
- Design AI to include source attributions in generated content
- Make traceability a core feature
- Preserve cultural context in outputs

**Step 5: Economic Fairness**
- Revenue sharing with training data creators
- Preferential licensing for marginalised creators
- Community benefit agreements for collective works

## Cultural Appropriation Prevention

### Defining Cultural Appropriation

**Cultural appropriation** is the adoption of elements from a marginalised culture by members of a dominant culture, especially when:
- Done without permission or understanding
- Strips cultural significance from its context
- Economically benefits the appropriator while harming the source community
- Treats culture as commodity or aesthetic

**Palimpsest protections**:
- Requires preservation of cultural context
- Mandates community acknowledgment
- Prevents decontextualisation
- Empowers creators to refuse harmful uses

### Cultural vs. Creative Exchange

**Appropriate exchange**:
- Initiated with community blessing
- Includes proper education about context
- Credits source community
- Shares economic benefits
- Ongoing relationship, not one-time extraction

**Appropriation**:
- Taken without asking
- Context stripped for marketability
- Profits flow away from source community
- One-directional extraction
- Treats culture as free resource

### Protections in Practice

**Sacred symbols**: Cannot be used decoratively or commercially without community consent, even if image is technically "public domain"

**Traditional knowledge**: Must credit specific communities, not genericise as "ancient wisdom"

**Language and dialects**: Respectfully preserved with cultural context, not exoticised

**Ritual and ceremony**: Cannot be commodified or performed out of context

**Music and dance**: Traditional forms credited to originating communities

### Case Study: Indigenous Symbols in Gaming

A game developer wants to use symbols from Indigenous Australian culture as game icons.

**Unethical approach**:
- Downloads public domain images of symbols
- Uses them as generic "tribal" aesthetic
- No acknowledgment of cultural origin
- Sells game internationally, profits entirely to developer

**Ethical approach (Palimpsest-compliant)**:
- Researches cultural significance of symbols
- Contacts relevant Indigenous communities
- Obtains permission (and potentially licensing agreement)
- Credits specific cultural origin in game
- Includes educational content about symbols' meaning
- Shares portion of revenue with community
- Ensures use is respectful and appropriate

## Diaspora Narrative Protection

### Why Diaspora Narratives Need Special Protection

**Diaspora narratives** — stories of displacement, migration, cultural preservation in new lands — are:
- **Emotionally heavy**: Carry intergenerational trauma
- **Culturally vital**: Preserve identity across displacement
- **Economically vulnerable**: Often exploited by mainstream media
- **Symbolically powerful**: Represent resistance to erasure

The Palimpsest License provides specific protections for these narratives.

### Core Protections

1. **Context Preservation**: Stories of displacement must preserve the specific history (not genericised to "immigration story")

2. **Community Acknowledgment**: If representing a diaspora community, acknowledge that community

3. **Emotional Weight**: Maintain the gravity of displacement; don't romanticise or trivialise

4. **Economic Justice**: When diaspora stories are commodified, benefits should flow to diaspora communities

### Common Exploitations to Prevent

**Romanticisation**:
- Turning forced migration into adventure narrative
- Erasing violence and trauma for palatability
- "Uplifting" stories that erase ongoing struggles

**Genericisation**:
- "Universal immigrant experience" that erases specific cultural contexts
- Combining multiple diaspora stories into vague "diversity"
- Treating all displacement as equivalent

**Extraction**:
- Using diaspora narratives for authenticity/diversity points
- Profiting from diaspora pain without community benefit
- One-time extraction with no ongoing relationship

**Appropriation**:
- Non-diaspora creators claiming authority over diaspora stories
- Fictional diaspora narratives that crowd out actual diaspora voices
- Using diaspora aesthetics without diaspora substance

### Ethical Diaspora Storytelling

**If you're from the diaspora**:
- Document your cultural position
- Acknowledge you speak for yourself, not all diaspora
- Preserve specific cultural and historical context
- Connect your story to broader community narratives

**If you're not from the diaspora but telling diaspora stories**:
- Engage deeply with actual diaspora communities
- Credit diaspora consultants and collaborators
- Share economic benefits
- Position your work as supporting, not replacing, diaspora voices
- Be transparent about your positionality

## Emotional Fidelity

### What Is Emotional Fidelity?

**Emotional fidelity** means maintaining the **emotional truth and complexity** of a work in derivatives, adaptations, and uses.

It's the opposite of **emotional flattening** — reducing complex emotions to simple tropes or marketable sentiments.

### Why It Matters

Emotional complexity is what makes art meaningful. When works are adapted, there's pressure to simplify:
- "Too dark" → lighten it
- "Too complex" → make it simple
- "Too specific" → make it universal
- "Too political" → make it neutral

The Palimpsest License resists this pressure by requiring **emotional fidelity** to the original.

### Examples

**Emotional fidelity preserved**:
A film adaptation of a novel about grief:
- Keeps the messiness and non-linearity of grief
- Doesn't force a redemptive arc
- Preserves moments of anger, numbness, dark humour
- Honours the original's refusal to "fix" the grief

**Emotional fidelity violated**:
Same adaptation, but:
- Adds uplifting ending not in original
- Removes "uncomfortable" emotions
- Makes grief a journey with clear stages
- "Resolves" the grief to make audience feel better

### Maintaining Fidelity in Different Media

**Text → Film**:
- Preserve emotional pacing (don't rush complex feelings)
- Keep ambiguity where original was ambiguous
- Visual language should match emotional weight

**Music → Samples/Remixes**:
- Preserve emotional tone (don't make sad songs upbeat)
- Acknowledge original emotional context
- Match energy and gravity

**Personal narrative → Documentary**:
- Let subjects control their emotional presentation
- Don't manipulate footage to create emotional arcs
- Preserve complexity and contradiction

---

## Collective Responsibility

### Creative Works as Collective Endeavours

Even when legally authored by an individual, creative works often emerge from:
- **Communities**: Cultural traditions, shared experiences
- **Mentors**: Teachers, influences, predecessors
- **Collaborators**: Named and unnamed contributors
- **Circumstances**: Historical moments, social movements

The Palimpsest License encourages acknowledging this collective dimension.

### Ethical Acknowledgment

**Instead of**: "I created this"
**Try**: "I created this, building on traditions from [community], taught by [mentors], in dialogue with [influences], during [historical context]"

This isn't false modesty — it's accurate acknowledgment of how creativity actually works.

### Revenue Sharing and Attribution Economies

When works generate significant revenue, the Palimpsest License encourages (but doesn't legally require) sharing benefits with:
- Communities whose traditions you drew from
- Mentors who taught you
- Collaborators (even informal ones)
- Social movements that inspired you

**Example**:
A successful novel drawing from oral traditions:
- Donate portion of proceeds to cultural preservation organisation
- Commission work from community artists
- Establish scholarship for community youth
- Fund cultural centre or library

---

## Ethics of Enforcement

### When to Enforce

**Enforcement is appropriate when**:
- Clear violation (metadata stripped, unauthorised AI training, etc.)
- Violator refuses friendly resolution
- Violation causes economic or cultural harm
- Pattern of violations suggests bad faith

**Consider alternatives when**:
- Violation appears accidental
- Violator is responsive and willing to remediate
- Educational approach might prevent future violations
- Restorative justice is possible

### Restorative vs. Punitive Approaches

**Punitive**: Focus on punishment, damages, forcing cessation
**Restorative**: Focus on repair, education, preventing recurrence

The Palimpsest License encourages **restorative approaches** when possible.

**Restorative enforcement**:
1. Contact violator to explain issue
2. Offer path to compliance
3. Educational resources about why it matters
4. Community mediation if needed
5. Public acknowledgment of error (learning opportunity)
6. Relationship-building rather than burning bridges

**Punitive enforcement** (when necessary):
- Cease and desist for serious violations
- Damages for economic harm
- Legal action for wilful infringement
- Public exposure of bad actors

### Community Enforcement

For works representing communities, consider **community involvement in enforcement**:
- Consult with community about whether to enforce
- Let community define appropriate remediation
- Share any damages/settlements with community
- Use enforcement as educational opportunity

---

## Restorative Justice Framework

### Principles

1. **Focus on harm**: What harm was done? (Not just "what rule was broken")
2. **Dialogue**: Bring violator and harmed party together (when safe/appropriate)
3. **Repair**: How can the harm be repaired?
4. **Prevent recurrence**: What systemic changes prevent this happening again?
5. **Community healing**: How does the community move forward?

### Application to License Violations

**Traditional approach**:
- Violation detected → Cease and desist → Lawsuit → Damages

**Restorative approach**:
- Violation detected → Contact and educate → Mediation → Agreed remediation → Public learning

**Example**:
AI company trains on Palimpsest works without consent.

**Restorative process**:
1. **Acknowledge harm**: Company acknowledges violating creator rights and cultural appropriation
2. **Remove from training**: Immediately cease using works
3. **Compensation**: Fair licensing fee for past use
4. **Future consent**: Implement proper consent checking going forward
5. **Public education**: Company publishes case study about why consent matters
6. **Community benefit**: Donation to cultural preservation organisation
7. **Ongoing relationship**: Become responsible user of Palimpsest works going forward

### When Restorative Justice Isn't Appropriate

- Violator refuses to acknowledge harm
- Pattern of wilful violations
- Power imbalance makes dialogue unsafe
- Violator is bad-faith actor
- Community prefers punitive approach

In these cases, traditional enforcement may be necessary.

## Ethical Violations and Remedies

### Taxonomy of Violations

| Violation Type         | Ethical Harm                          | Remediation Priority                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Metadata stripping     | Erases cultural lineage               | Restore metadata + public correction |
| Unauthorised AI use    | Commodifies without consent           | Cease use + compensation             |
| Cultural erasure       | Appropriation, community harm         | Restore context + community restitution |
| Emotional flattening   | Disrespects original's depth          | Re-release with fidelity or remove   |
| Ambient omission       | Makes credit easily lost              | Implement ambient attribution        |

### Remediation Examples

**Violation: Metadata Stripped**
- **Remediation**: Restore all metadata to distributed versions; issue correction notice; verify restoration
- **Community benefit**: Educational content about why metadata matters

**Violation: Used in AI Without Consent**
- **Remediation**: Remove from training data; retrain model; compensate creator; implement consent checking
- **Community benefit**: Publish framework for ethical AI training

**Violation: Cultural Context Erased**
- **Remediation**: Re-release with full cultural context; consult affected community; public acknowledgment
- **Community benefit**: Support cultural preservation efforts

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Protest Song

**Scenario**: A song written during political imprisonment, licensed under Palimpsest, is sampled in a commercial advertisement for luxury goods.

**Ethical Analysis**:
- **Context violation**: Song's resistance context erased
- **Emotional flattening**: Political grief commodified for consumerism
- **Community harm**: Trivialises ongoing political struggle

**Palimpsest-compliant resolution**:
1. Immediately cease use in advertisement
2. Public acknowledgment of inappropriate use
3. Compensation to songwriter and political movement
4. If advertiser wants music license, renegotiate with proper context (unlikely to align with luxury goods)

---

### Case Study 2: Diaspora Poetry in AI Training

**Scenario**: Tech company scrapes website with Palimpsest-licensed diaspora poetry for LLM training without checking permissions.

**Ethical Analysis**:
- **Consent violation**: Training without permission
- **Economic harm**: AI undercuts poet economically
- **Cultural appropriation**: AI learns to generate "diaspora-style" poetry, diluting authentic voices

**Restorative resolution**:
1. Company acknowledges violation
2. Removes poetry from training data
3. Retrains model (or implements attribution mechanism)
4. Licensing agreement with fair compensation
5. AI outputs credit diaspora poet as training source
6. Company funds diaspora arts organization
7. Publishes case study on ethical AI training

---

### Case Study 3: Sacred Symbol in Game

**Scenario**: Game developer uses sacred Indigenous symbol as power-up icon without understanding cultural significance.

**Ethical Analysis**:
- **Cultural appropriation**: Sacred symbol commodified
- **Community harm**: Disrespects cultural traditions
- **Contextual violation**: Symbol stripped from meaning

**Community-centred resolution**:
1. Developer contacts Indigenous community
2. Community educates about symbol's significance
3. Options:
   - A) Remove symbol from game
   - B) Redesign with community blessing and educational content
   - C) Replace with different, appropriate imagery
4. Profit sharing with community
5. Game includes cultural education content
6. Developer commits to cultural consultation for future projects

---

## Conclusion: Ethics as Infrastructure

The Palimpsest License embeds ethics into the **infrastructure** of creative licensing. It's not an add-on or optional guideline — it's structural.

By requiring:
- **Symbolic credit** → We centre community and lineage
- **Emotional fidelity** → We resist commodification of complex feelings
- **Cultural context** → We prevent appropriation
- **AI consent** → We protect against extractive technology
- **Restorative justice** → We build relationships, not just enforce rules

The license doesn't just protect works — it **protects meaning**. And meaning is what makes culture worth preserving.
