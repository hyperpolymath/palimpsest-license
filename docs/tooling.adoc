= Palimpsest Tooling: Provenance, Verification, and Audit
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 3

The Palimpsest Tooling Suite provides cryptographic and structural guarantees for projects using the Palimpsest‑MPL License.  
This document explains each tool, how they relate, and how they support provenance integrity.

toc::[]

== 1. pmpl-sign

`pmpl-sign` creates cryptographic signatures for files or artefacts.

=== Capabilities

* Sign files using supported algorithms  
* Embed provenance metadata  
* Attach SPDX identifiers  
* Prepare artefacts for verification and audit  

=== Planned Enhancements

* Post‑quantum signature support (Exhibit B)  
* Multi‑author lineage chains  
* Detached signature bundles  

== 2. pmpl-verify

`pmpl-verify` validates signatures and provenance metadata.

=== Capabilities

* Verify signatures created by `pmpl-sign`  
* Validate provenance chains  
* Confirm SPDX headers  
* Detect tampering or mismatched metadata  

=== Planned Enhancements

* Cross‑repository lineage verification  
* Integration with GitHub Releases  
* Machine‑readable verification reports  

== 3. pmpl-audit

`pmpl-audit` performs repository‑level audits.

=== Capabilities

* Check SPDX headers across the repo  
* Validate SCM manifests (`META.scm`, `ECOSYSTEM.scm`, etc.)  
* Detect missing or inconsistent provenance metadata  
* Produce audit summaries  

=== Planned Enhancements

* Scorecard integration  
* CI‑friendly JSON output  
* Policy‑driven audit profiles  

== 4. integrations

Templates and examples for:

* GitHub Actions  
* Git hooks  
* Pre‑commit frameworks  
* Release pipelines  

== Parser Work (Palimpsest Plasma)

The dedicated license parser is being developed in the Palimpsest Plasma repo (work in progress):

----
Local: /mnt/eclipse/repos/palimpsest-plasma
Remote: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/palimpsest-plasma
----

== Provenance Flow

----
Author → pmpl-sign → Artefact + Signature
Artefact + Signature → pmpl-verify → Verified Provenance
Repository → pmpl-audit → Compliance + Integrity Report
----

== Roadmap

=== v0.2

* PQ signature support  
* JSON audit reports  
* GitHub Action for automated signing  
* Integration with release artefacts  

=== v0.3

* Multi‑author lineage  
* Repository‑wide signature bundles  
* Cross‑repo provenance linking  

=== v1.0

* Full provenance graph  
* Machine‑verifiable lineage  
* Standardised audit profiles
