This document defines the structure, semantics, and lifecycle of Exhibits within the Palimpsest‑MPL License.  
Exhibits extend the license with normative or optional modules.

toc::[]

== 1. Purpose of Exhibits

Exhibits allow the license to:

* adapt to new domains  
* incorporate jurisdictional guidance  
* define optional modules (e.g., PQ cryptography)  
* provide narrative or ethical clarifications  
* evolve without destabilising the core license  

== 2. Exhibit Types

=== 2.1 Normative Exhibits
Binding components that modify or extend the license.

Examples:
* Exhibit A — Definitions  
* Exhibit B — Quantum‑Safe Cryptography  

=== 2.2 Informative Exhibits
Non‑binding clarifications, examples, or guidance.

Examples:
* Ethical Use Notes  
* Cultural Context Notes  

== 3. Exhibit Structure

Each exhibit MUST include:

* title  
* version  
* status (normative or informative)  
* SPDX identifier  
* change history  
* canonical text  

== 4. Versioning

Exhibits follow the same versioning rules as the PMPL license:

* `major.minor.patch`  
* normative exhibits require Council approval  
* informative exhibits may be updated more frequently  

== 5. Referencing Exhibits

Exhibits MUST be referenced using:

----
Exhibit-B:Quantum-Safe-Cryptography@1.0.0
----

== 6. Lifecycle

=== 6.1 Creation
Proposed via PR + Council review.

=== 6.2 Activation
Merged into `legal/exhibits/` and referenced in the license.

=== 6.3 Deprecation
Marked as deprecated but retained for historical lineage.

=== 6.4 Replacement
A new exhibit supersedes an older one.

== 7. Tooling Integration

`pmpl-audit` MUST:

* detect missing exhibit references  
* validate exhibit versioning  
* ensure SPDX identifiers match
