= Palimpsest‑MPL Specification Index
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 2

This index provides a unified entry point into the formal specification layer of the Palimpsest‑MPL ecosystem.  
Each document defines a different dimension of the license, its governance, its provenance model, and its ethical foundations.

toc::[]

== Core Specifications

* link:PMPL-SPEC.adoc[PMPL-SPEC] — Core license semantics, structure, and normative rules.
* link:EXHIBITS-SPEC.adoc[EXHIBITS-SPEC] — Exhibit lifecycle, structure, and semantics.
* link:ETHICAL-USE-SPEC.adoc[ETHICAL-USE-SPEC] — Ethical use, narrative boundaries, and cultural constraints.

== Provenance and Cryptography

* link:PROVENANCE-SPEC.adoc[PROVENANCE-SPEC] — Provenance metadata, signature formats, lineage rules.
* link:QUANTUM-SAFE-SPEC.adoc[QUANTUM-SAFE-SPEC] — Post‑quantum cryptography and future‑proofing.

== SCM Manifests

* link:6SCM-SPEC.adoc[6SCM-SPEC] — Specification for the Six SCM Manifests (META, ECOSYSTEM, PLAYBOOK, AGENTIC, NEUROSYM, GOVERNANCE).

== How These Specifications Interact

* PMPL-SPEC defines the license core.
* EXHIBITS-SPEC defines modular extensions.
* ETHICAL-USE-SPEC defines normative boundaries.
* PROVENANCE-SPEC defines how artefacts are signed, verified, and audited.
* QUANTUM-SAFE-SPEC defines cryptographic requirements.
* 6SCM-SPEC defines the machine‑readable governance and ecosystem structure.

Together, they form the complete Palimpsest‑MPL specification layer.
