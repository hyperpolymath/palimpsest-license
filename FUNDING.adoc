The Palimpsest‑MPL License is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and legal governance initiative stewarded by hyperpolymath and the Palimpsest Stewardship Council.  
This document explains how the project is funded, how contributions are used, and why community support matters.

== Purpose of Funding

The Palimpsest License exists to protect creators who work with narrative, trauma, mythology, cultural memory, and symbolic expression.  
Maintaining a living, ethical, provenance‑aware license requires:

* legal expertise  
* governance infrastructure  
* tooling and audits  
* documentation and accessibility  
* translation and jurisdictional analysis  

Community support ensures that the license remains stable, trustworthy, and stewarded with care.

== Ways to Support the Project

=== Transparent Funding (Recommended)
* **Open Collective:** `palimpsest-license`  
  Open accounting, public budgets, and transparent stewardship.

=== Other Platforms
* **Patreon:** `palimpsest-license`  
* **LiberaPay:** recurring micro‑donations  
* **Ko‑fi:** one‑time contributions  

These platforms help sustain ongoing development and governance work.

=== Cryptocurrency
* **Monero (XMR):** preferred for privacy‑preserving contributions  
  (See repository or contact maintainers for the current address.)

=== Corporate Sponsorship
Organizations whose values align with the license’s ethical, cultural, and provenance principles are welcome to discuss sponsorship.

To begin a conversation, contact the maintainers or the Palimpsest Stewardship Council via the channels listed in the repository README.

== How Funds Are Used

Funding supports the long‑term health and integrity of the project:

=== Reliability
* Maintaining a stable license text and exhibit structure  
* Ensuring documentation remains accurate and up to date  
* Supporting versioning and release processes  

=== Security
* Regular security audits  
* Hardening CI/CD workflows  
* Maintaining provenance tooling (`pmpl-sign`, `pmpl-verify`, `pmpl-audit`)  
* Ensuring cryptographic lineage remains trustworthy  

=== Accessibility
* WCAG 2.3 AAA compliance for all public‑facing materials  
* Clear, multilingual documentation  
* Inclusive onboarding for contributors and adopters  

=== Governance
* Supporting the work of the Palimpsest Stewardship Council  
* Jurisdictional analysis and legal review  
* Interpretive guidance and dispute mediation  

=== Tooling and Ecosystem
* Development and maintenance of provenance tools  
* SCM manifest evolution (`ECOSYSTEM.scm`, `META.scm`, `PLAYBOOK.scm`, etc.)  
* Research into ethical and neurosymbolic interfaces  

== Why Support Matters

The Palimpsest License is more than a legal document.  
It is a framework for ethical creation in a world shared by humans and algorithms — a space where narrative, memory, and symbolic meaning deserve protection.

Your support helps:

* keep the license alive, evolving, and legally sound  
* ensure creators retain agency and emotional lineage  
* build tools that make provenance auditable and humane  
* sustain a governance model rooted in care, clarity, and accountability
