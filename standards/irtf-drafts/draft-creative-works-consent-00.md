--- abstract

This document specifies a machine-readable consent and privacy framework for creative works in the context of artificial intelligence training, data scraping, and derivative work generation. It defines a consent declaration protocol that enables creators to express granular permissions for different types of AI and automated systems accessing their works, with particular attention to emerging technologies including autonomous AI, agentic systems, neural interfaces, and quantum computing applications.

The framework provides standardised machine-readable formats (JSON-LD, RDF, Protocol Buffers) for consent declaration, human-readable presentation requirements, security and privacy considerations, and integration with existing web standards. It addresses the gap between traditional copyright licensing and modern AI use cases where automated systems require explicit, machine-verifiable consent before processing creative content.

# Introduction

The proliferation of artificial intelligence systems and automated content processing has created a critical gap in how creators can express consent for the use of their works. Traditional copyright licensing mechanisms were not designed for machine-readable consent declaration, particularly for AI training, neural interface systems, or quantum computing applications.

This document specifies the Creative Works Consent Framework (CWCF), a comprehensive protocol for declaring, discovering, and verifying consent for automated processing of creative works. The framework enables creators to:

* Declare granular consent for different AI system types
* Specify attribution and lineage preservation requirements
* Express privacy and cultural heritage constraints
* Provide machine-readable and human-readable consent declarations
* Support both individual and collective governance models

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Definitions

**Creative Work**: Any original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression, including but not limited to literary, artistic, musical, dramatic, and multimedia works.

**AI System**: Any computational system capable of processing creative works for training, generation, analysis, or derivative creation, including but not limited to machine learning models, large language models, generative AI, and autonomous agents.

**Consent Declaration**: A machine-readable statement expressing the creator's permissions, restrictions, and requirements for AI system access to a creative work.

**Synthetic Output**: Content, data, or behaviour generated by an AI system that was trained on or derived from the creative work.

**Lineage Tag**: Machine-readable metadata embedded in synthetic outputs that traces derivation from original creative works.

**Emotional Lineage**: The symbolic, affective, and cultural significance embedded in a creative work that must be preserved in derivative uses.

**Collective Governance Body**: An organisation, DAO, community council, or other entity managing rights for collectively-owned works.

**Neural Interface (NI) System**: Brain-computer interface systems that translate neural signals to digital outputs or vice versa.

**Quantum AI (QAI) System**: AI systems operating on quantum computers using quantum entanglement and superposition.

## Scope

This specification applies to:

1. Web-hosted creative works accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
2. Distributed creative works with resolvable identifiers
3. Works with individual or collective governance structures
4. AI systems including but not limited to:
   - Large language models (LLMs)
   - Generative AI systems
   - Autonomous AI systems
   - Agentic AI systems
   - Ambient AI systems
   - Neural interface systems
   - Quantum AI systems

This specification does NOT apply to:

1. Fair use or fair dealing exceptions under applicable copyright law
2. Publicly-domain works (unless explicitly declared otherwise)
3. Works where consent mechanisms are legally prohibited

# Problem Statement

## Current Challenges

### 2.1. Lack of Machine-Readable Consent

Traditional copyright notices and license texts are designed for human interpretation. AI systems scraping web content cannot reliably determine:

* Whether a creator permits AI training on their work
* What types of AI systems are permitted or prohibited
* What attribution requirements apply to synthetic outputs
* What privacy or cultural constraints apply

### 2.2. Inadequate Granularity

Existing mechanisms (robots.txt, meta tags) provide binary allow/deny signals but cannot express:

* Different permissions for different AI system types
* Conditional consent based on attribution or compensation
* Privacy requirements for sensitive content
* Cultural heritage protocols for protected works

### 2.3. Attribution and Lineage Gaps

When AI systems generate synthetic outputs, there is no standardised mechanism to:

* Trace which original works contributed to the training
* Preserve attribution across transformation chains
* Maintain emotional and cultural context of source material
* Verify provenance in quantum or distributed systems

### 2.4. Governance Complexity

Creative works may be governed by:

* Individual creators
* Collectives and DAOs
* Cultural heritage bodies
* Multiple stakeholders with different rights

No existing protocol supports complex governance structures with machine-readable consent delegation.

### 2.5. Emerging Technology Gaps

New AI paradigms create novel challenges:

* **Neural Interfaces**: Require continuous consent and mental privacy
* **Quantum AI**: Need quantum-resistant provenance mechanisms
* **Autonomous AI**: Require human oversight and audit trails
* **Agentic AI**: Must disclose sub-agent interactions
* **Ambient AI**: Must preserve emotional context

Existing standards do not address these emerging use cases.

## Use Cases

### 2.6. Content Creator Protection

A journalist publishes investigative reporting and wants to:

* Prohibit AI training on the content
* Allow search engine indexing
* Require attribution if content influences AI outputs
* Maintain editorial control over synthetic derivatives

### 2.7. Cultural Heritage Preservation

An Indigenous community shares traditional stories and requires:

* Consent from cultural stewards before AI access
* Preservation of symbolic and spiritual context
* Prohibition on commercial exploitation
* Lineage tracking in all derivatives

### 2.8. Collective Rights Management

A musicians' cooperative licenses compositions and needs:

* DAO-governed consent approval process
* Benefit-sharing for AI-generated derivatives
* Transparent audit trail of AI system usage
* Enforcement mechanisms for violations

### 2.9. Privacy-Sensitive Content

A trauma counsellor publishes therapeutic resources and requires:

* Prohibition on neural interface usage without explicit consent
* Privacy preservation for individuals mentioned
* Sensitive content warnings for AI systems
* Revocation mechanisms if misuse occurs

# Technical Specification

## Consent Declaration Format

### 3.1. Discovery Mechanism

Consent declarations MUST be discoverable via one or more of the following mechanisms:

1. **Well-Known URI**: `/.well-known/creative-works-consent.json`
2. **HTTP Link Header**: `Link: <consent-uri>; rel="consent-declaration"`
3. **HTML Meta Tag**: `<link rel="consent-declaration" href="consent-uri">`
4. **HTTP Header**: `Creative-Works-Consent: <consent-uri>`

### 3.2. JSON-LD Format

The primary machine-readable format MUST be JSON-LD {{W3C.REC-json-ld11-20200716}} using the following schema:

~~~json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/",
    "cwcf": "https://palimpsestlicense.org/cwcf/v1#",
    "license": {"@id": "schema:license", "@type": "@id"},

    "stewards": ["https://example.org/steward1"],
    "protocols": ["https://example.org/cultural-protocol"]
  },
  "revocation": {
    "supported": true,
    "mechanism": "https://example.org/revoke",
    "noticePeriod": "P30D"
  }
}
~~~

### 3.3. Consent Values

Consent fields accept the following values:

* **"allow"**: Explicit permission granted
* **"deny"**: Explicit prohibition
* **"conditional"**: Permission subject to requirements (see "requirements" field)
* **"inherit"**: Inherit from license or parent declaration
* **"unspecified"**: No explicit declaration (MAY be treated as "deny" by conservative implementations)

### 3.4. AI System Types

The framework defines consent granularity for the following AI system types:

* **llm**: Large language models and generative text systems
* **vision**: Computer vision and image generation systems
* **audio**: Audio processing and generation systems
* **multimodal**: Systems combining multiple modalities
* **autonomous**: Systems operating without continuous human oversight
* **agentic**: Systems that delegate tasks to sub-agents
* **ambient**: Systems integrated into environmental contexts
* **neural-interface**: Brain-computer interface systems
* **quantum**: Quantum computing-based AI systems
* **general**: Default for unspecified AI types

### 3.5. Lineage Requirements

Lineage declarations specify metadata preservation requirements:

~~~json
{
  "lineage": {
    "required": true,
    "format": ["json-ld", "xml", "protobuf"],
    "quantumProof": true,
    "minimumFields": [
      "sourceWork",
      "sourceAuthor",
      "sourceLicense",
      "derivationDate",
      "aiSystem"
    ],
    "emotionalContext": {
      "preserve": true,
      "fields": ["intent", "culturalSignificance", "historicalContext"]
    }
  }
}
~~~

### 3.6. Attribution Requirements

Attribution declarations specify how creators must be credited:

~~~json
{
  "attribution": {
    "method": "symbolic",
    "required": true,
    "minimumFields": ["name", "title", "license"],
    "preserveEmotionalContext": true,
    "format": {
      "human": "Author Name, 'Work Title', License (Year)",
      "machine": "https://schema.org/CreativeWork"
    }
  }
}
~~~

## Protocol Buffers Alternative Format

### 3.7. Protobuf Schema

For high-performance applications, consent declarations MAY be expressed in Protocol Buffers:

~~~protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package cwcf.v1;

message ConsentDeclaration {
  string work_id = 1;
  string work_title = 2;
  repeated Author authors = 3;
  string license_url = 4;
  ConsentPermissions consent = 5;
  map<string, AITypeConsent> ai_types = 6;
  LineageRequirements lineage = 7;
  AttributionRequirements attribution = 8;
  Governance governance = 9;
  CulturalHeritage cultural_heritage = 10;
  RevocationPolicy revocation = 11;
}

message ConsentPermissions {
  ConsentValue training = 1;
  ConsentValue generation = 2;
  ConsentValue agentic = 3;
  ConsentValue analysis = 4;
  ConsentValue indexing = 5;
}

enum ConsentValue {
  UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  ALLOW = 1;
  DENY = 2;
  CONDITIONAL = 3;
  INHERIT = 4;
}

message AITypeConsent {
  ConsentValue consent = 1;
  repeated string requirements = 2;
}

message LineageRequirements {
  bool required = 1;
  repeated string formats = 2;
  bool quantum_proof = 3;
  repeated string minimum_fields = 4;

}

message EmotionalContext {
  bool preserve = 1;
  repeated string fields = 2;
}

message AttributionRequirements {
  string method = 1;
  bool required = 2;
  repeated string minimum_fields = 3;
  bool preserve_emotional_context = 4;
}

message Governance {
  string type = 1;
  string body_url = 2;
  bool approval_required = 3;
}

message CulturalHeritage {
  bool protected = 1;
  repeated string steward_urls = 2;
  repeated string protocol_urls = 3;
}

message RevocationPolicy {
  bool supported = 1;
  string mechanism_url = 2;
  string notice_period = 3;
}

message Author {
  string name = 1;
  string url = 2;
  string type = 3;
}
~~~

## RDF Alternative Format

### 3.8. RDF/Turtle Schema

For Semantic Web applications, consent declarations MAY be expressed in RDF/Turtle:

~~~turtle
@prefix cwcf: <https://palimpsestlicense.org/cwcf/v1#> .
@prefix schema: <https://schema.org/> .
@prefix dcterms: <https://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

<https://example.org/work> a schema:CreativeWork ;
    schema:name "Work Title" ;
    schema:author [
        a schema:Person ;
        schema:name "Creator Name"
    ] ;
    schema:license <https://example.org/license> ;
    cwcf:consent [
        cwcf:training cwcf:deny ;
        cwcf:generation cwcf:deny ;
        cwcf:agentic cwcf:deny ;
        cwcf:analysis cwcf:allow ;
        cwcf:indexing cwcf:allow
    ] ;
    cwcf:aiTypes [
        cwcf:llm [
            cwcf:consent cwcf:conditional ;
            cwcf:requirements "attribution"
        ] ;
        cwcf:neuralInterface [
            cwcf:consent cwcf:deny
        ]
    ] ;
    cwcf:lineage [
        cwcf:required true ;
        cwcf:format "json-ld", "xml" ;
        cwcf:quantumProof true
    ] .
~~~

## HTTP Integration

### 3.9. HTTP Status Code

When consent is denied and an AI system attempts to access a work, servers SHOULD return HTTP status code 430 (Consent Required) with a response body containing:

~~~json
{
  "error": "consent_required",
  "message": "This creative work requires explicit consent for AI processing",
  "consent_declaration": "https://example.org/.well-known/creative-works-consent.json",
  "license": "https://example.org/license",
  "contact": "mailto:creator@example.org"
}
~~~

### 3.10. HTTP Headers

Servers MAY include consent information in HTTP headers:

~~~
Creative-Works-Consent: training=deny; generation=deny; analysis=allow
Link: </.well-known/creative-works-consent.json>; rel="consent-declaration"
AI-Training: deny
AI-Generation: deny
~~~

## Verification and Validation

### 3.11. Signature Requirements

Consent declarations SHOULD be cryptographically signed to prevent tampering. Implementations MAY use:

* JSON Web Signatures (JWS) for JSON-LD declarations
* Detached PGP signatures for RDF declarations
* Blockchain-based attestations for collective governance

### 3.12. Validation Schema

JSON-LD consent declarations MUST validate against the JSON Schema published at:

`https://palimpsestlicense.org/cwcf/v1/schema.json`

### 3.13. Registry

A public registry of consent declarations MAY be maintained to enable:

* Discovery of works with specific consent profiles
* Verification of consent declaration authenticity
* Aggregation for collective governance bodies
* Audit trails for AI system compliance

# Human-Readable Presentation Requirements

## Display Requirements

### 4.1. Minimum Information

When presenting consent information to humans, implementations MUST display:

1. Creator name(s) and work title
2. License URL or identifier
3. Consent status for common AI operations (training, generation, analysis)
4. Attribution requirements
5. Contact information for consent requests

### 4.2. Accessibility

Human-readable presentations MUST comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility guidelines, including:

* Text alternatives for icons and symbols
* Sufficient colour contrast
* Keyboard navigation support
* Screen reader compatibility

### 4.3. Multilingual Support

Consent declarations SHOULD include human-readable text in multiple languages using the `@language` property in JSON-LD or `xml:lang` attributes.

### 4.4. Visual Indicators

Implementations MAY use standardised visual indicators (badges, icons) to communicate consent status. Example CSS classes:

* `.cwcf-allow` - Green check mark
* `.cwcf-deny` - Red prohibition symbol
* `.cwcf-conditional` - Yellow warning with conditions
* `.cwcf-collective` - Icon indicating collective governance

# Security Considerations

## Threat Model

### 5.1. Consent Declaration Tampering

**Threat**: Malicious actors modify consent declarations to permit unauthorised AI processing.

**Mitigation**: Cryptographic signatures on consent declarations with public key verification. Blockchain-based attestations for high-value works.

### 5.2. Consent Bypass

**Threat**: AI systems ignore consent declarations and scrape content anyway.

**Mitigation**:
* Technical enforcement at CDN/server level
* Legal enforcement through license breach provisions
* Audit mechanisms to detect unauthorised usage
* Watermarking to trace unauthorised synthetic outputs

### 5.3. Lineage Tag Stripping

**Threat**: Actors remove lineage tags from synthetic outputs to obscure provenance.

**Mitigation**:
* Multi-layer watermarking (visible and steganographic)
* Blockchain-based lineage registry
* Quantum-proof hash chains for lineage verification
* Legal penalties for lineage tag removal

### 5.4. Consent Confusion

**Threat**: Ambiguous or contradictory consent declarations lead to unintentional violations.

**Mitigation**:
* Strict schema validation
* Conflict resolution rules (most restrictive wins)
* Clear precedence hierarchy (work > collection > default)

### 5.5. Governance Impersonation

**Threat**: False claims of collective governance authority.

**Mitigation**:
* Verifiable credentials for governance bodies
* Public registry of recognised collective organisations
* Challenge-response mechanisms for verification

## Privacy Considerations

### 6.1. Creator Privacy

Consent declarations MAY expose information about creators including:

* Names and contact information
* Cultural affiliations
* Governance relationships

Implementations SHOULD support pseudonymous declarations with verifiable credentials.

### 6.2. Usage Tracking

Logging which AI systems access consent declarations could create privacy risks.

Mitigation:
* Aggregate statistics only
* Anonymised access logs
* User-controlled analytics opt-in

### 6.3. Sensitive Content

Works containing personal data, health information, or cultural secrets require enhanced protection.

Consent declarations SHOULD include:

~~~json
{
  "privacy": {
    "sensitiveContent": true,
    "category": ["personal-data", "cultural-heritage"],
    "minimumProtections": ["encryption", "access-control"],
    "gdprCompliant": true,
    "dataSubjectConsent": "required"
  }
}
~~~

# Implementation Considerations

## Backwards Compatibility

### 7.1. Robots.txt Integration

Implementations SHOULD respect existing robots.txt directives:

* `User-agent: AI*` entries
* `Disallow: /` for AI user agents
* Crawl-delay specifications

Consent declarations provide granular control beyond robots.txt but MUST NOT contradict explicit robots.txt denials.

### 7.2. Creative Commons Compatibility

Works licensed under Creative Commons SHOULD declare consent as:

* CC0: `consent.training = "allow"`
* CC-BY: `consent.training = "conditional", requirements = "attribution"`
* CC-BY-NC: `consent.training = "conditional", requirements = ["attribution", "non-commercial"]`
* CC-BY-ND: `consent.training = "deny"` (no derivatives implies no training)

### 7.3. Legacy Content

Content without explicit consent declarations SHOULD be treated as:

* Default to "deny" for training, generation, agentic use (conservative approach)
* Default to "allow" for analysis, indexing (compatible with traditional search)

## Performance Considerations

### 7.4. Caching

Consent declarations SHOULD be cached with appropriate `Cache-Control` headers:

~~~
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, stale-while-revalidate=604800
~~~

### 7.5. CDN Integration

Content Delivery Networks SHOULD enforce consent at edge locations to minimise unauthorised access.

### 7.6. Bulk Verification

AI systems training on large datasets SHOULD implement batch verification mechanisms to avoid overwhelming consent declaration servers.

## Audit and Compliance

### 7.7. Logging Requirements

AI systems SHOULD maintain audit logs including:

* Consent declaration retrieval timestamp
* Consent decision (allow/deny/conditional)
* Work identifier and creator
* AI system identifier and version
* Use type (training/generation/analysis)

### 7.8. Compliance Reporting

AI system operators SHOULD publish periodic compliance reports including:

* Number of works processed
* Consent status distribution
* Attribution compliance rate
* Lineage tag preservation rate
* Cultural heritage protocol adherence

# Internationalization

## Language Support

### 8.1. JSON-LD Language Tags

Consent declarations SHOULD include multilingual labels:

~~~json
{
  "@context": {
    "@language": "en"
  },
  "name": {
    "@value": "Work Title",
    "@language": "en"
  },
  "name_nl": {
    "@value": "Werk Titel",
    "@language": "nl"
  }
}
~~~

### 8.2. Unicode Support

All text fields MUST support full Unicode to accommodate:

* Non-Latin scripts
* Indigenous language orthographies
* Cultural symbols and diacritics

### 8.3. Cultural Adaptation

Consent concepts may vary across cultures. Implementations SHOULD support:

* Alternative governance models (elders, councils, consensus)
* Non-Western attribution practices (collective credit, ancestral acknowledgment)
* Culturally-specific consent protocols

# Extensibility

## Custom Extensions

### 9.1. Namespace Prefixes

Implementations MAY define custom extensions using namespace prefixes:

~~~json
{
  "@context": {
    "custom": "https://example.org/consent-extensions#"
  },
  "custom:specialRequirement": "value"
}
~~~

### 9.2. AI Type Extensions

New AI paradigms MAY be registered with custom type identifiers:

~~~json
{
  "aiTypes": {
    "holographic-ai": {
      "consent": "conditional",
      "requirements": "spatial-context-preservation"
    }
  }
}
~~~

### 9.3. Forward Compatibility

Parsers MUST ignore unknown fields to ensure forward compatibility with future specification versions.

# Security and Privacy Review

## Security Review

This specification has been reviewed for:

* Authentication and authorization mechanisms
* Data integrity protections
* Replay attack prevention
* Denial of service mitigation
* Privacy leak prevention

Key findings:

1. Cryptographic signatures required for high-value declarations
2. Rate limiting recommended for consent verification endpoints
3. HTTPS required for all consent declaration retrieval
4. Audit logging recommended for compliance verification

## Privacy Review

This specification has been reviewed for:

* Personal data exposure
* Tracking and profiling risks
* Consent withdrawal mechanisms
* Data minimisation principles

Key findings:

1. Support for pseudonymous creators recommended
2. Aggregate analytics only for usage tracking
3. Clear revocation mechanisms required
4. GDPR compatibility achieved through privacy controls

# Future Work

Potential areas for future specification development:

1. **Dynamic Consent**: Real-time consent negotiation protocols
2. **Micropayment Integration**: Standardised compensation mechanisms
3. **Federated Verification**: Distributed consent verification networks
4. **Quantum-Proof Lineage**: Post-quantum cryptographic lineage tags
5. **Neural Interface Ethics**: Enhanced protocols for brain-computer interfaces
6. **Collective Intelligence**: DAO integration and smart contract enforcement
7. **Cross-Border Enforcement**: International legal framework alignment
8. **Ambient AI Context**: Environmental preservation requirements

# Comparison with Existing Approaches

## robots.txt

* **Limitation**: Binary allow/deny, no AI granularity
* **Enhancement**: CWCF provides per-AI-type consent with conditions

## Creative Commons

* **Limitation**: Human-readable only, no machine consent
* **Enhancement**: CWCF adds machine-readable layer to CC licenses

## Open Data Rights Statement

* **Limitation**: Focus on data, not creative works
* **Enhancement**: CWCF addresses emotional lineage and cultural context

## Platform Terms of Service

* **Limitation**: Platform-specific, not portable
* **Enhancement**: CWCF is decentralised and creator-controlled

# Implementation Status

This section documents known implementations (to be updated):

* **Reference Implementation**: https://github.com/palimpsest-license/cwcf-reference
* **Validator**: https://validator.palimpsestlicense.org/cwcf
* **Libraries**: JavaScript, Python, Rust (planned)
